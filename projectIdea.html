        <h1>Project: Bang for Buck - Price comparison tool</h1>
        <div class="container-card">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">Name of idea:</h4>
            <p>Bang for buck (working title)</p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is it?</h4>
            <p>A price comparison community &amp; Site</p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is a Price comparison Site?</h4>
            <p>A price comparison site, sometimes called &ldquo;price analysis tool, comparison shopping agent, shop Bot, aggregator, comparison shopping agent&rdquo; provides a central location for consumers to filter and compare products based on price, features, reviews, and other criteria&nbsp;(Wikipedia, n.d.). Enabling consumers to compare products across different stores and brands. It is estimated that more than 10 million adults used price comparison websites before playing an order online. (Israr, 2021) Price comparison sites and tools can also be used to help retailers to observe the competition and offer the best price to budget-conscious consumers. (Israr, 2021)</p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">How do price comparison sites work?</h4>
            <p>Price Comparison sites use various technologies to compile data on potentially 1000&rsquo;s of products from dozen or even 100&rsquo;s retailers. The most common 3 are</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>Collecting data from Merchants &ndash; Retailers who then want to use the website, supply their own list of products and prices which is matched against the merchant database utilizing a mixture of information extraction, fuzzy logic, and human labour.(Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Data feeds &ndash; Price comparison site partner Merchant and/or retailers to retrieve a data feed file, a format is set and agreed upon and then imported into their website or they can provide their own API to the comparison site to add their product and pricing data direct to the site.(Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Data scrapping/Crawling &ndash; This method has price comparison site utilize technology to scan retailer web pages to retrieve pricing and product information.&nbsp;(Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Crowdsourcing &ndash; This allows price comparison sites to collect from any source such as visitors and those in their forum community, site usually use this method and come bine data with relative inputs and add it to their main database through collaborating filtering, artificial intelligence, or human labour. (Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>With inflation rising. (Hutchens, 2022)Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. At Bang for buck we believe There is a demand in the Australian market for consumers to be able to reliable secure good quality products at bang for buck prices and we believe we can help that. Take a site called Oz bargain for example. An Australian forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and services. It gets over a million Visitors A month&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022). It goes beyond just Australian consumer too; in the US it is believed that Price comparison websites take more than $800 million in commission each year. (Israr, 2021).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The initial inspiration for Bang for buck is because these days we at team TBD, do what we can to try and save money while also ensuring what we purchase is at-least half decent quality. As a result, we as consumers have spent hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price for it. Only to at the end of the effort we found ourselves asking was the time spent worth the money saved? Or worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if we didn&rsquo;t? As consumer we in the past have tried the other comparison sites and found them wanting lacking in either reliability, functionality, or both, some were clearly just marketing channel designer for retailers and not the Australian consumer. It is a controversial market in some filled with misleading, fake, or straight up fraudulent sites designed to take advantage of Australian consumers and not help them.&nbsp;(Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, 2014).Due to that, we at Team TBD were inspired to try and create Bang for buck. Our goals?</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                <li>A price comparison Site that had user centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3 class="headingTwo">So, what is Bang for Buck?</h3>
            <p>It is a price comparison Community &amp; site for the Australian market. Initially it will target the electronic product market, primarily focusing laptops, phones, and tablets. Our goal will be engaging with University Students and other budget conscious tech savvy consumers to create a price savvy community and deliver to accurate, cost-effective pricing and product data on a range of electronic enabling them to get the best products for the best price (Bang for buck). This will be achieved by focusing&nbsp; on useful features such as price history, robust review system that will utilize multiple review sources, intuitive and in-depth Product search, and Categorization feature to allow users to identify the best or alternative products and later down the track leveraging mobile apps to allow consumer to search for product utilizing OCR and QR/Barcode technology to they can compare on the move(for a full list of feature please see our similar sites/planned feature section) Once we have refined our functions and features with comprehensive feedback but from community, we&rsquo;d expand bang for buck to all Australian retail markets.</p>
            <h3 class="headingTwo">How will Bang for buck work?</h3>
            <p>Bang for buck will utilized a combination of 3 methods to deliver our user and community accurate and detailed pricing and product data utilizing the below free method</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>Data feed - Partnering with retailer we retrieve data via Data feed files &amp; API</li>
                <li>Crawling &ndash; Using Data scrapping bots and platform to pull data directly from the website</li>
                <li>Crowdsourcing &ndash; we engage our community to report changes on prices or sales for review to assist our crawling</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="headingTwo">Why should we care about Bang for buck?</h3>
            <p>Well for starters as the little guy and as budget conscious consumers ourselves we have vested interest in creating a user centric price comparison experience, driven by the community, for the community by focusing on delivering feature, function, and value to the consumer rather than the retailer. While we hope to create a profitable business model, the goal will be to source that profit from the community and put it back into the community by expanding the site to provide even more value. This is not a get rich site, this is something to give to the community and hopefully drive change that will benefit everyone involved.</p>

        <div class="container-card">
            <h2 class="headingOne">Similar Sites &amp; Planned Features</h2>
            <h3 class="headingTwo">Summary:</h3>
            <p>There are already plenty of price comparison sites and tools already available some even for the Australian market.&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022).&nbsp;(Hayes, 2022) A couple of which are either operated or backed by huge corporation with plenty of money such as Google shopping owned by google and little bird who is backed by the CBA&nbsp;(Statista, 2022)&nbsp;(Weber, 2021). Why would team TBD endeavour to build a price comparison site? How does Bang for buck planned to be innovative? Different? Dare we say better?</p>
            <p>We&rsquo;re doing this because we truly believe none of them do it well. Many sites lack what we would consider valuable functionality, like price history, list of actual price comparisons (many just list a singular price and expect the user to trust it&rsquo;s the lowest). There are plenty out there that are not reputable or reliable, &nbsp;or even, misleading or straight up fake &amp; fraudulent existing to deliver no real value to the consumer and even taking advantage of them (Wikipedia, n.d.)&nbsp;(Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, 2014). Many seem to be entirely focused on their retail partners. where we will be focused on creating value for our community.</p>
            <p>We believe we have identified 4 similar sites that would be potential competitors to Bang for buck offering if/when we are to go to market. These are:</p>
            <ol class="small-li">
                <li>Google Shopping (<a href="https://shopping.google.com.au">https://shopping.google.com.au</a> )</li>
                <li>Get price Australian (<a href="https://www.getprice.com.au">https://www.getprice.com.au</a>)</li>
                <li>Little Birdie (<a href="https://littlebirdie.com.au">https://littlebirdie.com.au</a> )</li>
                <li>Price Me (<a href="https://priceme.com.au">https://priceme.com.au</a>)</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>The criteria for which we chose the 4 above sites as our similar sites/competitors is as follow</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>Must have X amount of similar features/functionality to Bang for buck</li>
                <li>Must offer pricing and product data on electronics</li>
                <li>Must get over 5000 visitors a month</li>
                <li>Primary features and functions must be available as website</li>
                <li>Must offer a variety pricing/product data from various retailers not just 1 or 2.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="headingTwo">Planned Features/Comparison Table:</h3>
            <p>This table not only lists the planned features and functions of Bang for buck but compares to those similar sites/competitors mentioned. We believe this effectively highlights as-well as how plan to be different.</p>

            <h3 class="headingTwo">How will Bang for buck come to be?</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang for buck, we&rsquo;re also resource light in terms of budget and team resources.&nbsp; As a result, we&rsquo;re loosely using a lean methodology and have split the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of being able to send stock availability even online or close by.&nbsp; Before eventually expanding outside of the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer to utilize our platform.&nbsp; Those 5 phases are.</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Arguably the most important phase. This is where will be plan, prototype, and test our project idea. Bang for buck. At a whole level before moving onto the MVP to see if there is a desire for Bang for buck and it features, we will need to ensure we can build this. At a high level in this phase, we&rsquo;re going to need to develop a project plan, test our ability to scrap web data so we can provide data to our user&rsquo;s base and begin implementing the infrastructure and services we&rsquo;ll need to develop and deploy this bang for buck. Such as the AWS servers.</p>

                <p>Initially we are limiting ourselves to a subset of the Australian Retailer market and targeting a small subset of consumer. We believe this will be important to our product development as we think it the best way to achieve a robust and reliable price comparison tool by testing our extensive features and functions with a user base who can provide invaluable insight to what work, and what won&rsquo;t work. We believe we can achieve by targeting a such a niche market. Allowing us to get all our function and feature right before opening to the average consumer. &nbsp;During this phase we be heavily liaising and interacting with all of user base to get feedback on both our existing features we developed in in prototyping while implementing and receiving feedback on our next set of features, implementing our forum will be invaluable in helping us facilitate this.

                <p>Based on the results and feedback of the MVP, we will do a full product release that delivers the minimum amount of functionality we believe needed to deliver value back to our users and business. This will be first stage of bang for buck being a &ldquo;real product&rdquo; while we&rsquo;re already have done market research, cost analysis and speculate on our business model.

This project at-least for the purpose of this course (members of the team may work on out outside of university purposes) ended at the MVP except for MMF phase where we may pull components of that into the MVP (Mobile apps release). This section merely exists as a framework to the A3.&nbsp; This would be the stage where we really started to enter the market where we&rsquo;d expand our retailers to across all Australian Retail market and implement feature that would truly make Bang for Buck innovative compared to their competitors. Probably also the hardest stage for us as university student so likely won&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp;(Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>Below is a list of tools and technologies we&rsquo;ll likely used through the bang-for-buck project. This is non exhaustive list, there likely be lots of others. This just highlights what we believe to be the most heavily used or the primary tools and technologies</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A database server to store the huge amount of data our Web/Phone applications will process, likely stored via cloud providers AWS/Azure. Utilizing MySQL an open-source relational database management system. This will be used throughout the project. We likely used Amazon RDS for prototyping and RDP as it available in their free tier (Link to MYSQL wiki and Amazon RDS)</li>
                <li>Web/Application Front end hosting such as the AWS or Azure. We&rsquo;d likely utilize AWS free tier and use Amplify hosting for the front end and deployment</li>
                <li>A PAAS or BAAS from cloud service like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, such as AWS elastic Beanstalk or AWS Amplify CLI. We will utilize the Amplify toolchain from AWS to deploy prototype and potentially even MVP due to it easy integration with flutter. (Amazon, 2022)</li>
                <li>Web scrapping/Crawling bot. Designed to quickly scrap data off websites. We&rsquo;re going to investigate using scrapy, a data scraping framework library or similar, it is built in python. This will be used throughout the project but will begin in the prototyping stage.(Analytics Vidhya, 2017)</li>
                <li>Anaconda- is an open source-source python distribution platform, we&rsquo;ll be using this to program a web scrapping bot, likely using the scrapy library mentioned above. This will be used throughout the project but will begin in the prototyping stage we begin bringing our first chunk of product data by scraping from predefined list of electronic retailers. (Wikipedia, 2022)</li>
                <li>Text Editor for the code like Atom or notepad ++, visual studio code. This will also be used throughout our project an important tool for any website or app development. Each member with their own preference, however we may utilize Visual studio code due to its plugin for flutter. (Flutter, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Front end development, HTML, CSS, Javascript, DART platform. This will be used throughout the project- initially to develop a clean and concise landing page to promote the project as-well to register interest from perspective uses during the prototype phase as try to get a test user based for well testing.(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)&nbsp;(Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Back End. PHP, asp or asp.net, java, ruby on rails, python. We likely use several of these throughout the project. Python will be used in the developing of the web scrapy data. (Analytics Vidhya, 2017)(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                <li>Git for development and version history control to enable our team to effectively build the applications together. This will be instrumental throughout the project for quickly developing, testing, deploying, and re-testing and deploying through the quick. GIT will be the heart of our project, as it connects to flutter, Team member local repositories and our services. Using github to push and pull changes to develop our project quickly.</li>
                <li>Communication and collaboration tools such as Microsoft Team will be integral throughout the project. This will be used through all phases of the projects. The team is already using it, utilizing it various feature beyond such as Lists, Wiki, planner/tasks using it in a Kanban style board. As the project goes the team will likely more heavily rely on it.</li>
                <li>Data feed files and API &ndash; These technologies will be used to manage our partnerships with various retailers, enabling to either extract data from their e-commerce platform to push into our database or to push data from their systems straight into our database. (Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                <li>CDN &ndash; Known as Content delivery network- It essentially cache our website content making it available through multiple exchange point enabling our users and partners to access our content quickly from anywhere in Australia. CDN primary benefits are improving website load times, reducing bandwidth costs, increasing content availability and redundancy, and improving website security. This will be important for the project as our user and retailer pass grow. We&rsquo;d likely used aws CloudFront for our CDN provider as a part of the amplify tool chain. They offer a free tier, perfect for us to trial learning during our prototyping phase. (Akami, 2022) (Amazon, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Flutter &ndash; Is an open-source framework by google. It is a UI software multi-platform development kit. Allowing you to quickly develop natively compiled applications from a single codebase across multiple platforms. We will use Flutter to help us develop our application across multiple application this will be heavily used throughout the project starting in the Prototyping phase to develop a clean and simply front end for our web application.(Thomas, 2019)</li>
                <li>Xcode &ndash; Is Apple IDE (integrated Development environment), it used develop IOS,IPADPS apps. This is required to provide the framework for us developing our App that will be available on IOS/Andriod (Flutter, n.d.)(Apple, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Andriod Studio is Andriod/Googles IDE (integrated development), it used to develop android apps, this will be required to provide the framework for us developing our app that will be available on IOS/APP). This will be utilized in our MMF and MLP project phases.(TechTarget, n.d.)</li>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Below is a list of skills we&rsquo;ll likely require throughout he bang-for-buck project. This is non exhaustive list, there likely be lots of others. This just highlights what we believe to be the most relevant.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project management skills. Knowledge and experience with Lean, Agile, Kanban and other project methodologies would be invaluable through this project. Being our first product development project we&rsquo;ll likely haphazardly utilize and go through several project methodologies throughout the project even in this documentation we&rsquo;re borrowing from Lean processes. As-well as using a Kanban board to managing work for A2. This tied into our skills as we have member with basic project experience and skills who wishes to develop those as his ideal job to one day be a Senior Project Manager.(Meshchankina, 2022)&nbsp;(Agile Alliance, n.d.)</li>
                <li>Front End development. Knowledge and skills with HTML, CSS and JAVA will be invaluable through this project, from prototyping phase to the final phase. Such as the landing page in prototyping and testing. All of Team TBD have been exposed to these skills front end languages but this will be an opportunity to expand on them as they&rsquo;re a useful skill.&nbsp;(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                <li>Back-end Development skills. Knowledge and skills with backend languages like python are going to be critical to this project especially into the prototyping and MVP phases, as we require the ability to develop our own web scrapping bot, to initially begin collecting Product data. We have two members on this team who wish to be software engineer, this will be good opportunity for them to utilize practice and hone some of their skills. We have one already has some skills and experience with backend languages having worked as an application support specialist. (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                <li>Application Development skills IOS/Andriod. We will be utilizing Flutter to help us with this process, but it will require some knowledge and skills with Andriod studio and studio code, utilizing java and xswift languages.(Google, 2021) (DevMountain, 2022)</li>
                <li>Cloud Deployment and Implementation skills- During this project we will be heavily utilizes cloud service like the AWS environment due to their three tier, we will need skills to deploy, maintain our web application and database. Several members we likely be undertaking the freely available AWS courses in relation to this, as simultaneously learn and utilize these skills throughout the Lifecyle of the project. (Amazon, 2017)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>If this project was completed and successful, then we would have been successful in achieving the following</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                <li>A price comparison Site that had user centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Which is our motivation for creating this project in the first place. Utilizing our project phases in particular our MVP, we believe we can truly work with our consumers to create a product that can trust and provide their relevant and using product and pricing data. Ideally one day Bang for buck would be picked up by 100&rsquo;s of thousand if not millions of Australian to make better and more informed purchasing decision which has the potential to how the current Australian retail market functions.</p>
