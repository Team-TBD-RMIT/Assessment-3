        <p>
            Our teams’ ideal jobs offered quite the variation and each with a unique vision for their future careers.
            The job titles were as follows: Machine Learning Researcher, Senior Project Manager, Front End Web
            Developer, and two Software Engineers. As some of these roles are more specialized positions that didn’t
            offer many useful data that could accurately be portrayed in the Burning Glass Data requested  (Labour
            Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies), 2018) and other data resources, they were categorized into four
            umbrella Job Titles: Software Engineer, Web Developer, and IT Project Manager. These may vary slightly in
            name specification over the data sets, but each role accurately represents the main aspects of what the
            groups' position was described in both general and ICT skill sets required for the positions.

            </ul>
            <p>SAP (System Applications and Products in Data Processing) was not listed as one of our combined IT skills
                as it is a very specific software practice used in businesses to combine all operations and processes
                for successful exchanges of data and information within the business. Knowledge and use of this system
                falls under Business Management type roles that involve supervision and management of business within a
                company that includes operations, employee management, and assets, which none of our group members were
                striving for and thus explains why Business Management was also not a skill in our skill set.

            <h4>What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
            <p>
                There are many other general skills that contribute to a well-rounded and efficient professional but
                on the basis of the provided Burning glass data (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies), 2018)
                none of the stated general skills listed were missing from the general skill set of our group. This is
                due to the fact that the abilities displayed in each of our job titles are distinct enough to their own
                fields’ individual talents and requirements to when combined, nearly completely reflect the skills data
                from Burning Glass Baseline.

            <p>
                The burning glass data has changed my opinion of what type of job I want to pursue. I was not deeply
                attached to idea of being a web developer, but I believed it could have made more use of my existing
                skill set, like an understanding of how to make things visual appealing and eye catching. Which I
                learned through learning to paint though I’m not sure how well those skills would translate. I would
                prefer to pursue a job with a higher demand and future growth. As you can see in the SPL 2021 data web
                developer there is not a shortage in that job market, though web developer still has a strong future
                demand.<br>
                I think I would prefer to purse software engineer as it is in shortage and has strong future demand.
                While studying I am finding that I enjoy programming and learning new programming languages. Software
                engineering has a broad range of applications which means I have more option in terms of future
                employment. Though this change does mean I am pursuing a field in which I have no prior experience.

            <h2>Meg Maroni</h2>
            <p>
                Since looking at the information analysed above, my ideal position as a machine learning researcher has
                not altered. This is because the data offered and suggested for the research does not accurately reflect
                the job title and the required skill sets which it involves, such as a combination of other roles
                including software engineering, data science and analytics, mathematics, statistics, and of course
                machine learning. It is also an area in which I feel passionately interested in pursuing as researching
                for potential advancements in our machine learning technologies can improve every area of our economy
                and human life.<br>
                Last but not least, my choice has not changed because it is consistent with my estimate of where future
                technical improvements will occur based on my own investigation of the area and industry, including
                papers and articles such as from the CSIRO (CSIRO, 2022), the Australian (Powell, 2022), the Brilliant
                (Carter, 2021), and of course, the National Pulse Report (DIUS, 2021). All these articles support
                Machine Learning and its boundless possibilities and I would really like to be a part of that.

                In short no. The data only confirmed what I had already observed myself. If anything, it has only
                reinforced my desire to continue following the path I’m on. There appears to be a lot of opportunity
                down this path for an individual with the right skills and knowledge.  To be a good project manager you
                need to have terrific team and collaboration skills, you also need to be a creative problem solver with
                outstanding communications skills as-well as being knowledgeable in not just IT Technology but the
                business and industry you’re working with. Not only are these skills and knowledge I already have to
                some degree. They are also listed in the data as generally desirable skills across a range of roles.
                I also found the data insightful to my current position. I am already a system administrator; I was
                surprised to see the strong demand for this going into the future but a lack of shortages besides NSW.

            <p>
                Having reviewed the Burning Glass data, I am not worried about my future job prospects. In fact I see
                it as encouragement and affirmation. My current dream job of software engineer is highly sought after
                by a large margin and is predicted to only keep on growing. When looking at the IT-specific skills I
                can only smile as I plan on utilising SQL, Java, and JavaScript heavily in the future. Looking at the
                general skills I see plenty of room to improve: I like to think I have good communication skills
                however they decline quite sharply when not in face-to-face situations; my problem solving skills
                have been tried and tested many times in the past and they’ve rarely let me down, while my current
                organisation skills can certainly do with some improvement: like any person, with the right motivation
                and inspiration I can achieve anything, however in their absence I find myself drifting towards
                procrastination perhaps more readily than others. In summary my present goals for future employment
                remain the same or within the same field, while I have also illuminated areas for personal growth.

            <p>
                After looking at the burning glass data above, my opinion of my ideal job as a software engineer has
                not changed. The data provided aligns with my already existing perceptions of the role. Based on my
                previous work experiences with supporting businesses and their staff with the range of software
                applications that they would use to perform their duties, I have an understanding that modern
                businesses rely on multiple applications to operate successfully and that there would be a requirement
                for people with the skillsets to support, maintain, integrate, or extend those applications. With the
                ever-continuing innovation of technologies and the adoption of these innovative technologies in
                businesses, the demand for software programmers would continue to increase. The big difference in the
                number of occupations in the Software Developer/Engineer category compared to the rest of the
                categories in the Top Burning Glass Occupations graph indicates to me that it is a role that has a high
                demand.<br>
                At first, I was surprised that the Database, Systems Administrators, and ICT Security Category in the
                Labour Market Insights Data graph had a higher future-growth projection compared to Software and
                Applications Programmers but after thinking this through, it made a bit more sense to me. The rate at
                which society is capturing and storing data continues to grow exponentially as technology innovation
                continues. The increased number of data points captured, increased usage of IoT technologies, and the
                development of Machine Learning and the use of large data sets to train ML models are a few examples I
                can think of that leads me to understand why that category would have a higher future growth projection
                where the skillsets to administer the systems and databases is required. After thinking this through,
                I determined that it is another role that I would consider pursuing if I decided to change my mind about
                pursuing software engineering.
