        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our teams’ careers offered quite the variation as each team member has a unique career with components
            that different to the others. However, in terms of core skills and the starting points of a career plan to
            achieve them, the careers also had a lot of similarities. We believe these differences and similarities
            complimented both our current and previous assignment well. Allowing the individual to apply the skills
            of their futures careers in individual areas these assignments to beneficial results while working well
            as team. The teams' careers are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Scott Percival – Senior Project Manager
            </li>
            <li>
                Bronagh Falloon – Front End Developer
            </li>
            <li>
                Meg Maroni – Machine Learning Researcher
            </li>
            <li>
                Malachi Cleland – Software Engineer
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As some of these roles are more specialized positions that didn’t offer much useful data that could
            accurately be portrayed in the Burning Glass Data  (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies), 2018)
            and other data resources, they were categorized into 3 umbrella Job Titles: Software Engineer,
            Web Developer, and IT Project Manager. These may vary slightly in name specification over the data sets,
            but each role accurately represents the main aspects of what the groups careers are.

            <h2>Comparisons</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What common elements are there, if any?</h4>
            <p>
                As you can see from the data sets, the careers have some common ground.  Such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>All have strong number of jobs listing available</li>
                <li>All have a strong future demand</li>
                <li>There are shortages for IT managers and software engineers across Australia</li>
                <li>All 3 have a low Female workforce demographic that will hopefully change over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On top of the data set, the team review and believe our career also share the following similar
                elements.
            </p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>All roles require strong analytical and/or problem-solving skill.</li>
                <li>All roles require the person to have strong teamwork and collaboration skills.</li>
                <li>Several of the roles require various leadership skills.</li>
                <li>Several of the roles require familiarities and skills associated with project management,
                    either as part of the project or leading it.</li>
            </ul>
<!------------------------------------------------- -->
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What differentiates each position from the others?</h4>
            <p>
                As you can see, the data sets the careers also have some differences, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>Machine learning researcher failed to feature in the data sets on their own due their highly specialised nature and assumptions are made based on grouping it with ICT project management </li>
                <li>Software engineering is by far the most popular job according to the data in the IT industry both currently and in the future</li>
                <li>There are currently no shortages for Front end web developers based on the data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On top of the data set, the team reviewed and believe our career also have the following differences
                from each other.
            </p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>One role requires a Ph.D. before being eligible </li>
                <li>Two of the roles could be considered quite late-stage and advanced positions in one career path, requiring 10+ years of education or work experience while the others are reasonably more on the side of intermediary roles to be considered.</li>
                <li>Only one role requires skill or experience with graphic application such as Illustrator. </li>
                <li>
                    Only one role requires skills or knowledge specific to project methodologies PRINCE2, PMBOK, SCRUM, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only one role requires experience in sensor fusion or expertise in usage of signal and imaging processing practices and techniques
                </li>
            </ul>
<!------------------------------------------------- -->
            <h4 class="headingTwo">How similar or different are the career plans across the group?</h4>
            <p>
                As you can see from the career plan table below. Our teams' career plans at the most basic level are
                somewhat similar. All involved completing a relevant bachelor’s degree in information technology,
                computer science, information systems, software engineering, or similar certification. Most involve
                pursuing further expertise and skills by completing MOOC courses or similar such as Scriba or
                industrial-specific courses such as PRINCE2/PMBOK methodologies. Several involve working in similar
                roles to that of the group to build further work experience for eligibility for their desired roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where they differ, at least in two of the cases, is the timeline to reach a stage where the person would
                be considered skilled and experienced enough to fill such a position. Both Senior Project management
                and Machine Learning Researcher positions will require 10+ years of additional education and/or relevant
                work experience. Machine learning Researcher by far has the greatest academic requirements requiring
                a Ph.D. on top of establishing a career in similar roles prior to being eligible.
            </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                Team TBD's Careers and career plans are ultimately both similar and different. As is the nature of the
                IT industry.  Looking at the data all our career has strong future demand and growth, they all share
                similar skills, and we all are pursuing a similar path to obtain our goals. Completing both the previous
                and current assignment however these different and similarities have been invaluable to this
                performance, allowing us to work well as a team and to utilize our unique skills to meet the assignments
                requirements One of the big contrasts however, we believe discussing amongst ourselves as-well as
                reviewing our own data is the timeline to obtain some of these careers.  Two are obtainable relatively
                soon whereas the other are quite senior roles and will require many years of further education and
                experience before the team members would be realistically eligible to work in their planned careers.
