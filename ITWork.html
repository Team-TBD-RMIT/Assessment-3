            <h2>Overview & History</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">David Rowley</h4>
            <p>
                Leapfrog Business Solutions is operated by three partners David Rowley who takes care of the IT aspect
                and provisions of Leapfrog, Sandra Rowley his wife who has taken on the role of accounting and financial
                manager, and Krishna Menon, who manages the communications services of the business. The business was
                established in Albany in early 2006 after David migrated from the UK (United Kingdom). David’s IT career
                has spanned more than twenty years and his first big break was with Sage in the UK doing telephone
                support for their payroll products. Whilst performing this role he had a real keenness towards
                technologies and programmed I the background which led him to the research & development department of
                Sage, which was developing Telemagic, a CRM (Cause Related Marketing) branch scripting database of
                sales leads using Visual Fox pro.
                <br> <br>
                This product got moved onto another company which led David to follow and work with the new department
                doing further GUI (Graphical User Interface) development and server wrapping for accounting products.
                David kept working for many independent IT Consultancy companies in the UK, offering a range of services
                from programming to offering training in software. Eventually, David started his own consulting company
                with numerous long-term contracts, including offering development and business analysis services to
                Citibank in Sunderland, UK. Eventually David and his family decided they wanted to live in Australia
                after visiting the country in 2003 and in 2006 made their arrival to Albany, WA.

            <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>
            <p>
                David Rowley is one of three Directors of Leapfrog Business Solutions, where he oversees one of its two
                main divisions which entails network infrastructure, firewall security, website development, and some
                custom software designing. He also provides service engineering and IT support services for local
                businesses including typical fault finding, looking after computers, network infrastructures and
                consulting with clients to help them understand the newer technologies and about implementation of IT
                technologies withing their business infrastructure to improve processes and data storage as he has been
                in the process of decommissioning server environments around Albany and pushing them to the cloud,
                including their own on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers.
            </p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h4>
            <p>
                David is involved in interacting with many different clients, businesses and other IT professionals
                around Albany, as being a consultant requires client, both individual and business, interactions and
                he holds a very open-door policy when it comes to other businesses, competitors or freelancers to
                collaborate with the company on projects and tasks that may arise within his business and one of the
                current employees, Aaron, was working at the Community Living Association (CLA) as IT support and then
                he was hired as a contractor for Leapfrog Business Solutions. He originally started working in Albany
                at a company called Grace Removals as a software developer where he met and formed many friendships
                with other professionals including Ramin Majidi, who was the lead software developer for this project
                at the time. As he is currently working with a large disabilities service provider in Albany, he also
                mentioned a highlight of his role is the interactions he gets with his clients on the day-to-day who
                have high-functioning disabilities, so there is a real diversity in the environment and people David
                interacts with.
            </p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>
            <p>
                For the past 9 months David has been spending most of his time, 3 days a week, at the Community Living
                Association (CLA), a large disabilities support provider in Albany, as their sole IT support as they are
                one of their important clients and unfortunately lost their own IT department. The company has about 130
                staff, 30 in office and the rest in face-to-face support working roles. The work requires him to do a lot
                of hands-on tasks including mobile device management (MDM) with Microsoft MDM components, including the
                Microsoft 365 suite, deploying android tablets for the support workers to run their proprietary software
                called Flow Logic, a NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) compliant software made by an East coast
                data company called Data Nova.
            </p>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</h4>
            <p>
                It was mentioned that one of the harders tasks is keeping abreast of current technologies or the current
                trends within IT as the same time as making a living in order to help the businesses clients with the
                best possible current solutions that have future support and standing, which is why is has been
                encouraging and slowly moving the companies' clients that use their servers to the cloud. David also
                has taken a TAFE student on board recently and states that he was given some great new ideas and taught
                about things in the technology sphere he wasn’t even aware of, so it been beneficial to have a new set
                of eyes. He also noted demand is another thing that caused some difficulties as they are quite a small
                company (5 employees) and offer a broad range of services, so they do not advertise or promote their
                services publicly and rely on word of mouth to steadily continue their work to suit their staff
                arrangements and not flounder themselves which was why they hired Aaron as a casual contractor but
                would like to fully employ him as the demand is increasing for work and opportunities.
