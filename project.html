        <h1>Project: Bang for Buck - Price comparison tool</h1>
        <div class="container-card">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">Name of idea:</h4>
            <p>Bang for buck (working title)</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">Website</h4>
            <p>link here</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is it?</h4>
            <p>Bang 4 buck is a price comparison community & site currently in its planning, and prototype phase being
                developed by Team TBD.  During its initial features Bang 4 buck function and scope will be rather limit
                as we endeavour to develop a strong relationship with our userbase and create robust, functional, and
                beneficial pricing and product features for our community.
            </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will Bang 4 Buck</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang for buck, we’re also resource light in
                terms of budget and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and have split
                the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP
                targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest
                price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of
                being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before eventually expanding outside of
                the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer
                to utilize our platform.
            </p>
            <div class="container-card">
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>With inflation rising. (Hutchens, 2022)Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to
                    make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. At Bang for buck we believe There is a demand
                    in the Australian market for consumers to be able to reliable secure good quality products at bang for
                    buck prices and we believe we can help that. Take a site called Oz bargain for example. An Australian
                    forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and
                    services. It gets over a million Visitors A month&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022). It goes beyond just Australian
                    consumer too; in the US it is believed that Price comparison websites take more than $800 million in
                    commission each year. (Israr, 2021).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The initial inspiration for Bang for buck is because these days we at team TBD, do what we can to try
                    and save money while also ensuring what we purchase is at-least half decent quality. As a result, we
                    as consumers have spent hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price
                    for it. Only to at the end of the effort we found ourselves asking was the time spent worth the money
                    saved? Or worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if we didn&rsquo;t? As consumer
                    we in the past have tried the other comparison sites and found them wanting lacking in either
                    reliability, functionality, or both, some were clearly just marketing channel designer for retailers
                    and not the Australian consumer. It is a controversial market in some filled with misleading, fake, or
                    straight up fraudulent sites designed to take advantage of Australian consumers and not help them.&nbsp;
                    (Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, 2014).Due to that, we at Team TBD were inspired to try
                    and create Bang 4 buck. Our goals?</p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                    <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                    <li>A price comparison Site that had user centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                    <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                    <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container-card">
                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    There are already plenty of price comparison sites and tools already available some even for the Australian market. (Ozbargain, 2022). (Hayes, 2022) A couple of which are either operated or backed by huge corporation with plenty of money such as Google shopping owned by google and little bird who is backed by the CBA (Statista, 2022) (Weber, 2021). Why would team TBD endeavour to build a price comparison site? How does Bang for buck planned to be innovative? Different? Dare we say better?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We’re doing this because we truly believe none of them do it well. Many sites lack what we would consider valuable functionality, like price history, list of actual price comparisons (many just list a singular price and expect the user to trust it’s the lowest). There are plenty out there that are not reputable or reliable,  or even, misleading or straight up fake & fraudulent existing to deliver no real value to the consumer and even taking advantage of them (Wikipedia, n.d.) (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, 2014). Many seem to be entirely focused on their retail partners. where we will be focused on creating value for our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe we have identified 4 similar sites that would be potential competitors to Bang for buck offering if/when we are to go to market. These are

                    The criteria for which we chose the 4-above site as our similar sites/competitors is as follows

                <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
                <h4>Aims</h4>
                <p>
                    Team TBD aim for B4B (Bang for buck) is simple. To create a reliable and trustworthy price comparison platform for Australian consumers. With a vested interest ourselves as Budget conscious consumers, we aim to create an innovative user centric price comparison experience driven by the community, for the community by focusing on delivering features, functions, and value to the consumer rather than the retailer. B4B is not alone in this space, there are other Price comparison platforms out there that offer their services to Australian consumer. What Sets apart B4B from its competition however is two main components. Firstly, our purpose. Team TBD is not building B4B purely for profit hoping to get rich from the service we offer. Instead, we’re doing this to give something back to the very community we’re a part of while hopefully driving wider changes that will benefit all Australian consumers as mentioned before for the community by the community, whereas our competitors focus on profit for themselves and their retailer partners.  Secondly while in the latter stages of the project roll out B4B has several innovative features not yet implemented by our competitors that we believe make us truly unique. These are
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mobile App: None of our main 4 competitors currently have a mobile application within the Australian market. Not only will B4B have a free Mobile App on Android and IOS but these app will bring it with several other innovative features as seen below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Barcode/QR search function: With the B4B mobile apps our users will be able to scan the QR/Barcode of products instore which will match it against the site product database and show them prices (where applicable) of products in other stores, as-well as eventually suggesting similar products)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OCR search function: Like the Barcode/QR search function users will be able to use OCR technology to say scan the label of the desired product instore and match it against a product in our database to show them prices of products in other stores as-well as eventually suggesting similar products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shopping list: Users will eventually be able to build their own shopping lists on both our application and website. This shopping list will allow user to create a list using the site product subcategories/types (I.E Butter, bread, eggs) available from the database and the B4B platform will then populate that shopping list with products from within our database based on a specific criterion (I.E cheapest, closest to the user etc) so they’re able to get the most bang 4 buck from their shopping experience.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It will be a long road to develop B4B. To meet all our goals and to have to have all the planned function and features we planned to offer consumers. However, to begin with we have 3 main initial goals that we believe will help us one day get there.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    Create a prototype data scrapper: A data scrapper will be an integral tool to enable success of B4B.  As mentioned B4B plans to use several methods to collect it product and pricing data one of them being scrapping data from internet. This method will be especially utilized in the early days of B4B while we have little to no retailer partners providing us with access to their product lists through other methods. We need to be sure we can utilize a data scrapper otherwise B4B may never get off the ground
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Create a prototype Database: One day there will be 1000’s if not 1000’s of thousands of product available on B4B Platform and likely 10’s of 1000’s pricing records that we will need to store and analyse to be able to deliver the functions and features we intend to deliver to our consumers, to make this possible we will need to create a robust database to store this data that the data scrapper and our retail partner data will be able to easily and reliably inputted into and then outputted out onto the side for our users to easily review relevant data such are product and pricing information.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Create a prototype website with limited functionality and range: As with any new product or service we need to produce a functioning prototype as a proof of concept to ensure the idea works. We intend to create a basic website with our limited range and functionality to do so. You can view the scope and limits of the prototype website in our scope and limits section
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>
                <h4>How will Bang 4 Buck come to be?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang 4 buck, we’re also resource light in terms of financials and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and have split the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before eventually expanding outside of the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer to utilize our platform.  Those 5 phases are.

                    <h3 class="headingTwo">Phase 1: Planning &amp; Testing &amp; Prototype</h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>Arguably the most important phase. This is where will be plan, prototype, and test our project idea. Bang for buck. At a whole level before moving onto the MVP to see if there is a desire for Bang for buck and it features, we will need to ensure we can build this. At a high level in this phase, we&rsquo;re going to need to develop a project plan, test our ability to scrap web data so we can provide data to our user&rsquo;s base and begin implementing the infrastructure and services we&rsquo;ll need to develop and deploy this bang for buck. Such as the AWS servers.</p>

                    <h3 class="headingTwo">Phase 2: MVP (Minimum viable product)</h3>
                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Initially we are limiting ourselves to a subset of the Australian Retailer market and targeting a small subset of consumer. We believe this will be important to our product development as we think it the best way to achieve a robust and reliable price comparison tool by testing our extensive features and functions with a user base who can provide invaluable insight to what work, and what won&rsquo;t work. We believe we can achieve by targeting a such a niche market. Allowing us to get all our function and feature right before opening to the average consumer. &nbsp;During this phase we be heavily liaising and interacting with all of user base to get feedback on both our existing features we developed in in prototyping while implementing and receiving feedback on our next set of features, implementing our forum will be invaluable in helping us facilitate this. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Based on the results and feedback of the MVP, we will do a full product release that delivers the minimum amount of functionality we believe needed to deliver value back to our users and business. This will be first stage of bang for buck being a &ldquo;real product&rdquo; while we&rsquo;re already have done market research, cost analysis and speculate on our business model. This is where we will begin focusing on working on partnership with consumers. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                    <p>At this point hopefully been for bang for buck will have positively received and our user base expanding with at-least a couple of partners. This is where we will start implementing features that will really set us apart from our competition such as the shopping list and release of our application to their respective App stores. The goal is to release feature that enhance user loyalty and encourage our users to use the platform, as-well as help us begin generating some revenue. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

This project at-least for the purpose of this course (members of the team may work on out outside of university purposes) ended at the MVP except for MMF phase where we may pull components of that into the MVP (Mobile apps release). This section merely exists as a framework to the A3.&nbsp; This would be the stage where we really started to enter the market where we&rsquo;d expand our retailers to across all Australian Retail market and implement feature that would truly make Bang for Buck innovative compared to their competitors. Probably also the hardest stage for us as university student so likely won&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp;(Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                <p>
                    With such a small team, the team ultimately wore many hat throughout the A3 project, including graphic design to design branding, login, look and feel of our idea, cloud engineering to setup the infrastructure possible to host our prototype website and database, making many of the artefacts accessible to the public. As-well as being a Creative director and marketing manager setting up our presentation and other promotional artefacts to promote our project. The team also worked closely as a result often roles would overlap each off us helping the other achieve their tasks. In saying all this the team had 4 primary roles each member identified as and were mostly responsible for and they were split up as follow:                 </p>
                <h4>Scott Percival: Project Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    Scott throughout this project has worked primarily as a project manager both leading and supporting the team. Responsible for planning out and managing this project. This was an instrumental role keeping the projects on tasks and working with the team to help complete their goals. In this role scott was crucial to developing the over-all A3 report, managing the planner, tasks list, developing a product roadmap and various checklists and other written/admin to free up time for the rest of the team to focus on deliverables and tasks enabling them do their best work.                 </p>
                <h4>Meg Maroni: Lead Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Meg throughout this project has primarily led all aspect of the development process, working closely with the rest of the development team. Responsible for leading the development team and basically turning Scott’s plans into realities. Meg Led the development on the majority of functioning artefacts, including the team website, the prototype website and creating the database that it runs off as well as been integral to the testing of the prototypes.
                </p>
                <h4>Bronagh Falloon: Front-End Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Bronagh throughout this project has work primarily as a Front-End Developer and has been crucial to over-all look, feel and design throughout these projects. Responsible for ensuring not only our deliverables functional but look good and are easy to navigate.  Bronagh developed the wireframes/Mockups of the website and app, assisted with the Front-End development of the Team and Prototype site.
                </p>
                <h4>Malachi Cleland: Back-End Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Malachi through this project has worked primarily as the back-end developer. Responsible for ensuring the core functionality of the prototype was achievable. Malachi developed the prototype data scrapping, allowing our prototype to collect product data and display it on our website. Malachi was also responsible for helping develop the Database and the back end of the prototype website.

We likely used Amazon RDS for prototyping and RDP as it available in their free tier (Link to MYSQL wiki and Amazon RDS)</li>
                    <li>Web/Application Front end hosting such as the AWS or Azure. We&rsquo;d likely utilize AWS free tier and use Amplify hosting for the front end and deployment</li>
                    <li>A PAAS or BAAS from cloud service like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, such as AWS elastic Beanstalk or AWS Amplify CLI. We will utilize the Amplify toolchain from AWS to deploy prototype and potentially even MVP due to it easy integration with flutter. (Amazon, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Web scrapping/Crawling bot. Designed to quickly scrap data off websites. We&rsquo;re going to investigate using scrapy, a data scraping framework library or similar, it is built in python. This will be used throughout the project but will begin in the prototyping stage.(Analytics Vidhya, 2017)</li>
                    <li>Anaconda- is an open source-source python distribution platform, we&rsquo;ll be using this to program a web scrapping bot, likely using the scrapy library mentioned above. This will be used throughout the project but will begin in the prototyping stage we begin bringing our first chunk of product data by scraping from predefined list of electronic retailers. (Wikipedia, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Text Editor for the code like Atom or notepad ++, visual studio code. This will also be used throughout our project an important tool for any website or app development. Each member with their own preference, however we may utilize Visual studio code due to its plugin for flutter. (Flutter, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>Front end development, HTML, CSS, Javascript, DART platform. This will be used throughout the project- initially to develop a clean and concise landing page to promote the project as-well to register interest from perspective uses during the prototype phase as try to get a test user based for well testing.(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)&nbsp;(Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>Back End. PHP, asp or asp.net, java, ruby on rails, python. We likely use several of these throughout the project. Python will be used in the developing of the web scrapy data. (Analytics Vidhya, 2017)(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Git for development and version history control to enable our team to effectively build the applications together. This will be instrumental throughout the project for quickly developing, testing, deploying, and re-testing and deploying through the quick. GIT will be the heart of our project, as it connects to flutter, Team member local repositories and our services. Using github to push and pull changes to develop our project quickly.</li>
                    <li>Communication and collaboration tools such as Microsoft Team will be integral throughout the project. This will be used through all phases of the projects. The team is already using it, utilizing it various feature beyond such as Lists, Wiki, planner/tasks using it in a Kanban style board. As the project goes the team will likely more heavily rely on it.</li>
                    <li>Data feed files and API &ndash; These technologies will be used to manage our partnerships with various retailers, enabling to either extract data from their e-commerce platform to push into our database or to push data from their systems straight into our database. (Wikipedia, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>CDN &ndash; Known as Content delivery network- It essentially cache our website content making it available through multiple exchange point enabling our users and partners to access our content quickly from anywhere in Australia. CDN primary benefits are improving website load times, reducing bandwidth costs, increasing content availability and redundancy, and improving website security. This will be important for the project as our user and retailer pass grow. We&rsquo;d likely used aws CloudFront for our CDN provider as a part of the amplify tool chain. They offer a free tier, perfect for us to trial learning during our prototyping phase. (Akami, 2022) (Amazon, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>Flutter &ndash; Is an open-source framework by google. It is a UI software multi-platform development kit. Allowing you to quickly develop natively compiled applications from a single codebase across multiple platforms. We will use Flutter to help us develop our application across multiple application this will be heavily used throughout the project starting in the Prototyping phase to develop a clean and simply front end for our web application.(Thomas, 2019)</li>
                    <li>Xcode &ndash; Is Apple IDE (integrated Development environment), it used develop IOS,IPADPS apps. This is required to provide the framework for us developing our App that will be available on IOS/Andriod (Flutter, n.d.)(Apple, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>Andriod Studio is Andriod/Googles IDE (integrated development), it used to develop android apps, this will be required to provide the framework for us developing our app that will be available on IOS/APP). This will be utilized in our MMF and MLP project phases.(TechTarget, n.d.)</li>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Below is a list of skills we&rsquo;ll likely require throughout he bang-for-buck project. This is non exhaustive list, there likely be lots of others. This just highlights what we believe to be the most relevant.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project management skills. Knowledge and experience with Lean, Agile, Kanban and other project methodologies would be invaluable through this project. Being our first product development project we&rsquo;ll likely haphazardly utilize and go through several project methodologies throughout the project even in this documentation we&rsquo;re borrowing from Lean processes. As-well as using a Kanban board to managing work for A2. This tied into our skills as we have member with basic project experience and skills who wishes to develop those as his ideal job to one day be a Senior Project Manager.(Meshchankina, 2022)&nbsp;(Agile Alliance, n.d.)</li>
                    <li>Front End development. Knowledge and skills with HTML, CSS and JAVA will be invaluable through this project, from prototyping phase to the final phase. Such as the landing page in prototyping and testing. All of Team TBD have been exposed to these skills front end languages but this will be an opportunity to expand on them as they&rsquo;re a useful skill.&nbsp;(GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Back-end Development skills. Knowledge and skills with backend languages like python are going to be critical to this project especially into the prototyping and MVP phases, as we require the ability to develop our own web scrapping bot, to initially begin collecting Product data. We have two members on this team who wish to be software engineer, this will be good opportunity for them to utilize practice and hone some of their skills. We have one already has some skills and experience with backend languages having worked as an application support specialist. (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Application Development skills IOS/Andriod. We will be utilizing Flutter to help us with this process, but it will require some knowledge and skills with Andriod studio and studio code, utilizing java and xswift languages.(Google, 2021) (DevMountain, 2022)</li>
                    <li>Cloud Deployment and Implementation skills- During this project we will be heavily utilizes cloud service like the AWS environment due to their three tier, we will need skills to deploy, maintain our web application and database. Several members we likely be undertaking the freely available AWS courses in relation to this, as simultaneously learn and utilize these skills throughout the Lifecyle of the project.

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>If this project was completed and successful, then we would have been successful in achieving the following</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                    <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                    <li>A price comparison Site that had user centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                    <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                    <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which is our motivation for creating this project in the first place. Utilizing our project phases in particular our MVP, we believe we can truly work with our consumers to create a product that can trust and provide their relevant and using product and pricing data. Ideally one day Bang for buck would be picked up by 100&rsquo;s of thousand if not millions of Australian to make better and more informed purchasing decision which has the potential to how the current Australian retail market functions.</p>
