            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is it?</h4>
            <p>Bang 4 buck is a price comparison community & site currently in its planning, and prototype phase being
                developed by Team TBD.  During its initial features Bang 4 buck function and scope will be rather limit
                as we endeavour to develop a strong relationship with our userbase and create robust, functional, and
                beneficial pricing and product features for our community.
            </p>
            <!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will Bang 4 Buck</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang for buck, we’re also resource light in
                terms of budget and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and have split
                the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP
                targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest
                price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of
                being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before eventually expanding outside of
                the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer
                to utilize our platform.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>With inflation rising. (Hutchens, 2022)Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to
                    make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. At Bang for buck we believe There is a demand
                    in the Australian market for consumers to be able to reliable secure good quality products at bang for
                    buck prices, and we believe we can help that. Take a site called Oz bargain for example. An Australian
                    forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and
                    services. It gets over a million Visitors A month&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022). It goes beyond just Australian
                    consumer too; in the US it is believed that Price comparison websites take more than $800 million in
                    commission each year. (Israr, 2021).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The initial inspiration for Bang for buck is because these days we at team TBD, do what we can to try
                    and save money while also ensuring what we purchase is at-least half decent quality. As a result, we
                    as consumers have spent hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price
                    for it. Only to at the end of the effort we found ourselves asking was the time spent worth the money
                    saved? Or worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if we didn&rsquo;t? As consumer
                    we in the past have tried the other comparison sites and found them wanting, lacking in either
                    reliability, functionality, or both, some were clearly just marketing channel designer for retailers
                    and not the Australian consumer. It is a controversial market in some filled with misleading, fake, or
                    straight up fraudulent sites designed to take advantage of Australian consumers and not help them.&nbsp;
                    (Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, 2014).Due to that, we at Team TBD were inspired to try
                    and create Bang 4 buck. Our goals are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                    <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                    <li>A price comparison site that had user-centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                    <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                    <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container-card">
                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    There are already plenty of price comparison sites and tools already available some even for the
                    Australian market. (Ozbargain, 2022). (Hayes, 2022) A couple of which are either operated or backed
                    by huge corporation with plenty of money such as Google shopping owned by google and little bird
                    who is backed by the CBA (Statista, 2022) (Weber, 2021). Why would team TBD endeavour to build a
                    price comparison site? How does Bang for buck planned to be innovative? Different? Dare we say
                    better?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We’re doing this because we truly believe none of them do it well. Many sites lack what we would
                    consider valuable functionality, like price history, list of actual price comparisons (many just
                    list a singular price and expect the user to trust it’s the lowest). There are plenty out there
                    that are not reputable or reliable,  or even, misleading or straight up fake & fraudulent existing
                    to deliver no real value to the consumer and even taking advantage of them (Wikipedia, n.d.)
                    (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, 2014). Many seem to be entirely focused on their
                    retail partners. where we will be focused on creating value for our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe we have identified 4 similar sites that would be potential competitors to Bang for buck
                    offering if/when we are to go to market. These are:

                <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
                <h4>Aims</h4>
                <p>
                    Team TBD aim for B4B (Bang for buck) is simple. To create a reliable and trustworthy price
                    comparison platform for Australian consumers. With a vested interest ourselves as Budget conscious
                    consumers, we aim to create an innovative user centric price comparison experience driven by the
                    community, for the community by focusing on delivering features, functions, and value to the
                    consumer rather than the retailer. B4B is not alone in this space, there are other Price comparison
                    platforms out there that offer their services to Australian consumer. What Sets apart B4B from
                    its competition however is two main components. Firstly, our purpose. Team TBD is not building B4B
                    purely for profit hoping to get rich from the service we offer. Instead, we’re doing this to give
                    something back to the very community we’re a part of while hopefully driving wider changes that will
                    benefit all Australian consumers as mentioned before for the community by the community, whereas
                    our competitors focus on profit for themselves and their retailer partners.  Secondly while in the
                    latter stages of the project roll out B4B has several innovative features not yet implemented by
                    our competitors that we believe make us truly unique. These are:
                </p>
                <ol class="small-li">
                    <li>
                        Mobile App: None of our main 4 competitors currently have a mobile application within the
                        Australian market. Not only will B4B have a free Mobile App on Android and IOS but these app
                        will bring it with several other innovative features as seen below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Barcode/QR search function: With the B4B mobile apps our users will be able to scan the
                        QR/Barcode of products instore which will match it against the site product database and show
                        them prices (where applicable) of products in other stores, as-well as eventually suggesting
                        similar products)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OCR search function: Like the Barcode/QR search function users will be able to use OCR
                        technology to say scan the label of the desired product instore and match it against a
                        product in our database to show them prices of products in other stores as-well as eventually
                        suggesting similar products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shopping list: Users will eventually be able to build their own shopping lists on both our
                        application and website. This shopping list will allow user to create a list using the site
                        product subcategories/types (I.E Butter, bread, eggs) available from the database and the B4B
                        platform will then populate that shopping list with products from within our database based on
                        a specific criterion (I.E cheapest, closest to the user etc.) so they’re able to get the most
                        bang 4 buck from their shopping experience.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It will be a long road to develop B4B. To meet all our goals and to have all the planned functions
                    and features we planned to offer consumers. However, to begin with we have 3 main initial goals
                    that we believe will help us one day get there.
                </p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>
                        Create a prototype data scrapper: A data scrapper will be an integral tool to enable success of B4B.
                        As mentioned, B4B plans to use several methods to collect it product and pricing data one of them
                        being scrapping data from internet. This method will be especially utilized in the early days of
                        B4B while we have little to no retailer partners providing us with access to their product lists
                        through other methods. We need to be sure we can utilize a data scrapper otherwise B4B may never
                        get off the ground
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a prototype database: One day there will be 1000’s if not 1000’s of thousands of products
                        available on B4B Platform and likely 10’s of 1000’s pricing records that we will need to store
                        and analyse to be able to deliver the functions and features we intend to deliver to our consumers,
                        to make this possible we will need to create a robust database to store this data that the data
                        scrapper and our retail partner data will be able to easily and reliably inputted into and then
                        outputted out onto the side for our users to easily review relevant data such are product and
                        pricing information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a prototype website with limited functionality and range: As with any new product or service
                        we need to produce a functioning prototype as a proof of concept to ensure the idea works. We
                        intend to create a basic website with our limited range and functionality to do so. You can view
                        the scope and limits of the prototype website in our scope and limits section

                <h4>How will Bang 4 Buck come to be?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang 4 buck, we’re also resource light in
                    terms of financials and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and
                    have split the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially
                    provide an MVP targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the
                    current cheapest price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product
                    and the convenience of being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before
                    eventually expanding outside-of the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying
                    to encourage all Australian consumer to utilize our platform.  Those 5 phases are:

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        Arguably the most important phase. We are currently planning, building our prototype and will be testing our project idea, B4B (Bang 4 buck). Before moving onto the MVP to see if there is a desire for Bang 4 buck and it features, we will need to ensure we can build this. At a high level in this phase, we’re developing a project plan, creating a functional prototype database, web scrapper and website. We are also testing our ability to scrap web data so we can provide data to our user base. We have also begun implementing the infrastructure and services we’ll need to develop and deploy this bang 4 buck such as utilizing AWS so we can deploy the prototypes for further usage and feedback testing by users.

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Initially we are limiting ourselves to a subset of the Australian Retailer market and targeting a small subset of consumers. We believe this will be important to our product development as we think it the best way to achieve a robust and reliable price comparison tool by testing our extensive features and functions with a user base who can provide invaluable insight to what work, and what won’t work. We believe we can achieve by targeting a niche market such as University student and budget conscious tech savvy individuals. Allowing us to get all our function and feature right before opening to the average consumer.  During this phase we be heavily liaising and interacting with all of user base to get feedback on both our existing features we developed in in prototyping while implementing and receiving feedback on our next set of features, implementing our forum will be invaluable in helping us facilitate this.

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>If you’re still reading this, congratulations. At this stage We’re just going to be honest with you this phase isn’t going to get much attention. This project at-least for the purpose of this course (members of the team may work on out outside of university purposes) ended at the MVP except for MMF phase where we may pull components of that into the MVP (Mobile apps release). This section merely exists as a framework to the A3.  This would be the stage where we really started to enter the market where we’d expand our retailers to across all Australian Retail market and implement feature that would truly make Bang for Buck innovative compared to their competitors. Probably also the hardest stage for us as university student so likely won’t be done. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                <p>
                    With such a small team, the team ultimately wore many hats throughout the A3 project, including
                    graphic design to design branding, login, look and feel of our idea, cloud engineering to setup the
                    infrastructure possible to host our prototype website and database, making many of the artefacts
                    accessible to the public. As-well as being a Creative director and marketing manager setting up our
                    presentation and other promotional artefacts to promote our project. The team also worked closely
                    as a result often roles would overlap each off us helping the other achieve their tasks. In saying
                    all this the team had 4 primary roles each member identified as and were mostly responsible for and
                    they were split up as seen below.  </p>
                <h4 class="headingTwo">Scott Percival: Project Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    Scott throughout this project has worked primarily as a project manager both leading and supporting
                    the team. Responsible for planning out and managing this project. This was an instrumental role keeping
                    the projects on tasks and working with the team to help complete their goals. In this role scott was
                    crucial to developing the over-all A3 report, managing the planner, tasks list, developing a product
                    roadmap and various checklists and other written/admin to free up time for the rest of the team to
                    focus on deliverables and tasks enabling them to do their best work.
                </p>
                <h4 class="headingTwo">Meg Maroni: Lead Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Meg throughout this project has primarily led all aspect of the development process, working closely
                    with the rest of the development team. Responsible for leading the development team and basically
                    turning Scott’s plans into realities. Meg Led the development on the majority of functioning artefacts,
                    including the team website, the prototype website and creating the database that it runs off as
                    well as been integral to the testing of the prototypes.

                <h4 class="headingTwo">Bronagh Falloon: Front-End Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Bronagh throughout this project has work primarily as a Front-End Developer and has been crucial to
                    over-all look, feel and design throughout these projects. Responsible for ensuring not only our
                    deliverables functional but look good and are easy to navigate.  Bronagh developed the wireframes/Mockups
                    of the website and app, assisted with the Front-End development of the Team and Prototype site.
                </p>
                <h4 class="headingTwo">Malachi Cleland: Back-End Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Malachi through this project has worked primarily as the back-end developer. Responsible for ensuring
                    the core functionality of the prototype was achievable. Malachi developed the prototype data
                    scrapping, allowing our prototype to collect product data and display it on our website. Malachi was
                    also responsible for helping develop the Database and the back end of the prototype website.

                <p>
                    Bang 4 buck has been divided into 5 phases. Team TBD will not be able to complete all phases within
                    time available for this project. However, you can expect the scope of this project to include all
                    components outlined in Phase 1 contained within the project and progress section of this report.
                    If possible, we will also within the time allotted to us begin making inroads into the other phases
                    other projects.  It is important within any project to clarify what is and isn’t the scope of a project.
                </p>

                <h4 class="headingTwo">Scope Limitations</h4>
                <p>
                    Below is a list of limitation and boundaries of the current scope. Due to resource and time
                    constraints many of the functions and deliverables will be limited compared to their final version
                    if had complete the project and its phases in its entirety.
                </p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>The price comparison function will source prices from a minimum of 2 retailers. As this is all that is required to produce a proof of concept for our capabilities to scrap data.  Additional retailer price may be included in the submitted prototype but is outside of current scope and subject to resource availability </li>
                    <li>Products available on the prototype where pricing and product data can be viewed will be limited to a minimum of dozen products. Again, we feel this is enough to establish a proof of concept. Gathering the data from the product manufacturer may not be possible within the time allotted so we may have to manually input the product for the scrapper to match against. Any additional products displayed in the final prototype is outside of current scope.  </li>
                    <li>Product Categorization will be limited to the following 3 electronic categories laptops, tablets, and phones. Each category will have 2-6 subcategories. Additional Categories may be added but outside of scope of current project</li>
                    <li>Wireframes will be limited to the following pages

                    <li>
                        Web scrapper code available as a deliverable will merely be an example of the code that can be used by another to test and confirm the functionality of it, it is not necessarily a representation of the full code used on the prototype application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Testing and feedback. Testing of the prototype site will be limited to 25 users’ likely other university students; the test will confirm the site is function that they’re able to retrieve pricing listed on the site are accurate as-well as to provide feedback of what they think of the premise of B2B. The testing of the web scrapping code will be limited to being able to manually run the code and retrieve pricing data from a single source from at-least 2 products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database Design deliverables will be limited to the data dictionary, entity relationship diagram and SQL scripts including schema, pre-population with selected data from web scrapper, and queries for testing purposes.

                    Below is a list of tools and technologies we have used throughout the Bang 4 Buck Project. This is
                    non-exhaustive list. There are lots of others. This just highlights what we believe to be the most
                    heavily used/important tools and technologies used throughout the project so far

                    <li>
                        MYSQL: Is a relational database management system. We required one to build our prototype
                        database we selected MySQL because it is popular database management system, our team have had
                        prior experience with it, it is open source, reliable, scalable, and fast. We used version
                        8.0.30 (MySQL, 2022)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        WebStorm by JetBrains: Was the primary text/code editor used throughout project for several
                        members of the team for a multitude of tasks including coding the team website, the prototype
                        website etc.

                    <li>
                        Visual studio code: A source code edited developed by Microsoft that can be used with a variety
                        of programming languages such as Javascript, pyhton, C++, Rust. Visual studio code uses the same
                        editor component seen within Azure Devops. We used version 1.70.2.  (Wikipedia, 2022). This was
                        used to build the SQL scripts and test them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Front end development: we used HTML, CSS, for both the team and prototype website. (

                    <li>
                        Python:  We used python to create the Web Scrapper that scrap product and pricing data from
                        various website such as Jw.com.au to populate into our prototype website. Python is a popular
                        high-level general-purpose language used for a range of purposes such as web development,
                        automation, and data analysis. We used version 3.8 of python  (Analytics Vidhya, 2017)(Coursera, 2022)

                    <li>
                        GitHub: We used GitHub heavily for both our team and prototype website. This was used as version
                        control for our codes for both websites. We also used it to host both websites temporarily via
                        GitHub pages GitHub is primarily a version control hosting service using GIT which is a
                        distribution version control. Primary used for software development version control. It is
                        popular website, now owned by Microsoft. It has many features and functions including such as
                        GitHub page which allow you to effectively host your own website through them. (Wikipedia, 2022)

                    <li>
                        Microsoft Teams: We have used this heavily and is integral part of the project process,
                        we’ve used it to communicate with team members, collaborate using a variety of its features and
                        functions, such as screen sharing, working on documents simultaneously. We have used to track
                        the progress of our tasks and project using the planner and sharepoint lists. Microsoft Team as
                        seen above is a communication and collaboration tool made by Microsoft that has lot of features

                <p>
                    Throughout the project build, testing was integrated within the development process along each stage
                    of deliverable development that was subjectable to testing parameters, as well as continual debugging
                    along the way. The following two spreadsheets demonstrate the testing process that was followed,
                    with PASS and FAIL parameters to accurately test functionality of the database and web scraper in
                    their sandbox environments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These tests would be continually implemented at each stage of the development process and multiple
                    test ID’s and differing parameters would be fed through to optimize program efficiency and debug as
                    much as possible before releasing the BETA test to a select group. User testing was planned when the
                    database, website and web scraping tool were fully operational as one entity, but unfortunately due
                    to time constraints this was not achievable.

                <p>
                    Below you’ll see two sections, a product roadmap with when we expect to complete all 5 stages of this project plan as-well as a timeframe tabling, how Team TBD have and will have spent the first 15 weeks of this project. The two use somewhat different date ranges we the reality is we do not have the resources to complete all stages of the project including all the planning required before beginning the project to be completed within 15 weeks highlighted in the timeframe. Both the timeframe and roadmap are based off the idea that each member will have approximately 10 hours a week to work on the Bang 4 buck project.

                    The group communicated through Microsoft Teams. All communication excluding instances where the non-communication escalation matrix is implemented will be conducted through MS team. This includes via Team meeting and using the post and chat functions within Microsoft Teams.

                <h4 class="headingTwo">How often did meetings take place</h4>

                    MS Teams impromptu meetings – 1 meeting a week for general catchup and discussion about project, between whole group and individual components contributors.<br>
                    MS Teams Milestone/Deadline meetings – When milestone have been completed or deadlines have been approached that do not fall within the normal official meeting schedule. The team will conduct special meeting to review and discuss the milestone or deadline outcome.

                <p>
                    We have introduced an escalation matrix for the team regarding a lack of communication. This matrix has been designed to attempt to give members who do not communicate every opportunity to respond before remainder of the team are required to reach out to faculty. All members have reviewed this escalation Matrix and agreed to it. Members aren’t required to communicate every day, but this matrix comes into the effect from the first meeting missed where the member has not prior notified anyone else on the team that they would not be attending.

                    <span style="font-weight: bold">96 hours:</span> Our meeting are roughly every 4 days at this point the member will obviously if they have still not communicated be in that meeting either. Their continued absence will be discussed in the meeting and the team will start discussing the possibility of reassigning the members workload and who will likely be responsible for what if they don’t communicate. Any tasks that have an impending deadline will be immediately reassigned to another member.  At this stage an email will be drafted to the faculty

                    <span style="font-weight: bold">120 hours:</span> The email notifying the faculty of the team communication issue with this member will be sent.

                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">192 hours:</span> If the member has not communicated, they will have missed their 3rd meeting. As a result, the team will have no choice but to treat the member as having left the team. Their workload will be re-assigned, and the team members will continue ahead with the assignment as if the member was no longer a part of the team until communication stating otherwise has been received.
