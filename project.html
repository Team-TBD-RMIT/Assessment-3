        <h1>Project: Bang for Buck - Price comparison tool</h1>
        <div class="container-card">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">Name of idea:</h4>
            <p>Bang for buck (working title)</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">Website</h4>
            <p>link here</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is it?</h4>
            <p>Bang 4 buck is a price comparison community & site currently in its planning, and prototype phase being
                developed by Team TBD.  During its initial features Bang 4 buck function and scope will be rather limit
                as we endeavour to develop a strong relationship with our userbase and create robust, functional, and
                beneficial pricing and product features for our community.
            </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will Bang 4 Buck</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang for buck, we’re also resource light in
                terms of budget and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and have split
                the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP
                targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest
                price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of
                being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before eventually expanding outside of
                the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer
                to utilize our platform.
            </p>
            <div class="container-card">
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>With inflation rising. (Hutchens, 2022)Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to
                    make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. At Bang for buck we believe There is a demand
                    in the Australian market for consumers to be able to reliable secure good quality products at bang for
                    buck prices and we believe we can help that. Take a site called Oz bargain for example. An Australian
                    forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and
                    services. It gets over a million Visitors A month&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022). It goes beyond just Australian
                    consumer too; in the US it is believed that Price comparison websites take more than $800 million in
                    commission each year. (Israr, 2021).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The initial inspiration for Bang for buck is because these days we at team TBD, do what we can to try
                    and save money while also ensuring what we purchase is at-least half decent quality. As a result, we
                    as consumers have spent hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price
                    for it. Only to at the end of the effort we found ourselves asking was the time spent worth the money
                    saved? Or worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if we didn&rsquo;t? As consumer
                    we in the past have tried the other comparison sites and found them wanting lacking in either
                    reliability, functionality, or both, some were clearly just marketing channel designer for retailers
                    and not the Australian consumer. It is a controversial market in some filled with misleading, fake, or
                    straight up fraudulent sites designed to take advantage of Australian consumers and not help them.&nbsp;
                    (Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, 2014).Due to that, we at Team TBD were inspired to try
                    and create Bang 4 buck. Our goals?</p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>A reputable and transparent platform that Australian consumers can trust</li>
                    <li>A platform that only lists products from reputable retailers that constantly reviews the products within database to avoid fake or poor-quality products.</li>
                    <li>A price comparison Site that had user centric features that help the consumer not just the retailer market their product.</li>
                    <li>An App that allows consumers to find good deals even when on the move and in store.</li>
                    <li>To give back to budget-conscious consumer community and all Australia consumers and help drive change to the Australia retail market</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container-card">
                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    There are already plenty of price comparison sites and tools already available some even for the Australian market. (Ozbargain, 2022). (Hayes, 2022) A couple of which are either operated or backed by huge corporation with plenty of money such as Google shopping owned by google and little bird who is backed by the CBA (Statista, 2022) (Weber, 2021). Why would team TBD endeavour to build a price comparison site? How does Bang for buck planned to be innovative? Different? Dare we say better?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We’re doing this because we truly believe none of them do it well. Many sites lack what we would consider valuable functionality, like price history, list of actual price comparisons (many just list a singular price and expect the user to trust it’s the lowest). There are plenty out there that are not reputable or reliable,  or even, misleading or straight up fake & fraudulent existing to deliver no real value to the consumer and even taking advantage of them (Wikipedia, n.d.) (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, 2014). Many seem to be entirely focused on their retail partners. where we will be focused on creating value for our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe we have identified 4 similar sites that would be potential competitors to Bang for buck offering if/when we are to go to market. These are

                <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
                <h4>Aims</h4>
                <p>
                    Team TBD aim for B4B (Bang for buck) is simple. To create a reliable and trustworthy price comparison platform for Australian consumers. With a vested interest ourselves as Budget conscious consumers, we aim to create an innovative user centric price comparison experience driven by the community, for the community by focusing on delivering features, functions, and value to the consumer rather than the retailer. B4B is not alone in this space, there are other Price comparison platforms out there that offer their services to Australian consumer. What Sets apart B4B from its competition however is two main components. Firstly, our purpose. Team TBD is not building B4B purely for profit hoping to get rich from the service we offer. Instead, we’re doing this to give something back to the very community we’re a part of while hopefully driving wider changes that will benefit all Australian consumers as mentioned before for the community by the community, whereas our competitors focus on profit for themselves and their retailer partners.  Secondly while in the latter stages of the project roll out B4B has several innovative features not yet implemented by our competitors that we believe make us truly unique. These are
                </p>
                <ol class="small-li">
                    <li>
                        Mobile App: None of our main 4 competitors currently have a mobile application within the Australian market. Not only will B4B have a free Mobile App on Android and IOS but these app will bring it with several other innovative features as seen below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Barcode/QR search function: With the B4B mobile apps our users will be able to scan the QR/Barcode of products instore which will match it against the site product database and show them prices (where applicable) of products in other stores, as-well as eventually suggesting similar products)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OCR search function: Like the Barcode/QR search function users will be able to use OCR technology to say scan the label of the desired product instore and match it against a product in our database to show them prices of products in other stores as-well as eventually suggesting similar products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shopping list: Users will eventually be able to build their own shopping lists on both our application and website. This shopping list will allow user to create a list using the site product subcategories/types (I.E Butter, bread, eggs) available from the database and the B4B platform will then populate that shopping list with products from within our database based on a specific criterion (I.E cheapest, closest to the user etc) so they’re able to get the most bang 4 buck from their shopping experience.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It will be a long road to develop B4B. To meet all our goals and to have to have all the planned function and features we planned to offer consumers. However, to begin with we have 3 main initial goals that we believe will help us one day get there.
                </p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                <li>
                    Create a prototype data scrapper: A data scrapper will be an integral tool to enable success of B4B.  As mentioned B4B plans to use several methods to collect it product and pricing data one of them being scrapping data from internet. This method will be especially utilized in the early days of B4B while we have little to no retailer partners providing us with access to their product lists through other methods. We need to be sure we can utilize a data scrapper otherwise B4B may never get off the ground
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a prototype Database: One day there will be 1000’s if not 1000’s of thousands of product available on B4B Platform and likely 10’s of 1000’s pricing records that we will need to store and analyse to be able to deliver the functions and features we intend to deliver to our consumers, to make this possible we will need to create a robust database to store this data that the data scrapper and our retail partner data will be able to easily and reliably inputted into and then outputted out onto the side for our users to easily review relevant data such are product and pricing information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a prototype website with limited functionality and range: As with any new product or service we need to produce a functioning prototype as a proof of concept to ensure the idea works. We intend to create a basic website with our limited range and functionality to do so. You can view the scope and limits of the prototype website in our scope and limits section
                </li>

                <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>
                <h4>How will Bang 4 Buck come to be?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of planned features and functionality for Bang 4 buck, we’re also resource light in terms of financials and team resources.  As a result, we’re loosely using a lean methodology and have split the product development into 5 phases. (Meshchankina, 2022) With the aim to initially provide an MVP targeted at university student and Budget conscious techy savvy individual with the current cheapest price on an electronic product that also shows the price history of the product and the convenience of being able to send stock availability even online or close by.  Before eventually expanding outside of the electronic market across all Australian Retailer markets trying to encourage all Australian consumer to utilize our platform.  Those 5 phases are.

                    <h3 class="headingTwo">Phase 1: Planning &amp; Testing &amp; Prototype</h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>Arguably the most important phase. This is where will be plan, prototype, and test our project idea. Bang for buck. At a whole level before moving onto the MVP to see if there is a desire for Bang for buck and it features, we will need to ensure we can build this. At a high level in this phase, we&rsquo;re going to need to develop a project plan, test our ability to scrap web data so we can provide data to our user&rsquo;s base and begin implementing the infrastructure and services we&rsquo;ll need to develop and deploy this bang for buck. Such as the AWS servers.</p>

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Initially we are limiting ourselves to a subset of the Australian Retailer market and targeting a small subset of consumer. We believe this will be important to our product development as we think it the best way to achieve a robust and reliable price comparison tool by testing our extensive features and functions with a user base who can provide invaluable insight to what work, and what won&rsquo;t work. We believe we can achieve by targeting a such a niche market. Allowing us to get all our function and feature right before opening to the average consumer. &nbsp;During this phase we be heavily liaising and interacting with all of user base to get feedback on both our existing features we developed in in prototyping while implementing and receiving feedback on our next set of features, implementing our forum will be invaluable in helping us facilitate this. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Based on the results and feedback of the MVP, we will do a full product release that delivers the minimum amount of functionality we believe needed to deliver value back to our users and business. This will be first stage of bang for buck being a &ldquo;real product&rdquo; while we&rsquo;re already have done market research, cost analysis and speculate on our business model. This is where we will begin focusing on working on partnership with consumers. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

This is where we will start implementing features that will really set us apart from our competition such as the shopping list and release of our application to their respective App stores. The goal is to release feature that enhance user loyalty and encourage our users to use the platform, as-well as help us begin generating some revenue. (Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

This project at-least for the purpose of this course (members of the team may work on out outside of university purposes) ended at the MVP except for MMF phase where we may pull components of that into the MVP (Mobile apps release). This section merely exists as a framework to the A3.&nbsp; This would be the stage where we really started to enter the market where we&rsquo;d expand our retailers to across all Australian Retail market and implement feature that would truly make Bang for Buck innovative compared to their competitors. Probably also the hardest stage for us as university student so likely won&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp;(Meshchankina, 2022)</p>

                    With such a small team, the team ultimately wore many hat throughout the A3 project, including graphic design to design branding, login, look and feel of our idea, cloud engineering to setup the infrastructure possible to host our prototype website and database, making many of the artefacts accessible to the public. As-well as being a Creative director and marketing manager setting up our presentation and other promotional artefacts to promote our project. The team also worked closely as a result often roles would overlap each off us helping the other achieve their tasks. In saying all this the team had 4 primary roles each member identified as and were mostly responsible for and they were split up as follow:                 </p>

                <h4 class="headingTwo">Scope Limitations</h4>
                <p>
                    Below is a list of limitation and boundaries of the current scope. Due to resource and time constraints many of the functions and deliverables will be limited compared to their final version if had complete the project and its phases in its entirety
                </p>
                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>The price comparison function will source prices from a minimum of 2 retailers. As this is all that is required to produce a proof of concept for our capabilities to scrap data.  Additional retailer price may be included in the submitted prototype but is outside of current scope and subject to resource availability </li>
                    <li>Products available on the prototype where pricing and product data can be viewed will be limited to a minimum of dozen products. Again, we feel this is enough to establish a proof of concept. Gathering the data from the product manufacturer may not be possible within the time allotted so we may have to manually input the product for the scrapper to match against. Any additional products displayed in the final prototype is outside of current scope.  </li>
                    <li>Product Categorization will be limited to the following 3 electronic categories laptops, tablets, and phones. Each category will have 2-6 subcategories. Additional Categories may be added but outside of scope of current project</li>
                    <li>Wireframes will be limited to the following pages
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Home page
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Search
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Product

                    <li>
                        The product Roadmap will feature the roadmap to Phase 5 of the project, beyond that is outside current scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web scrapper code available as a deliverable will merely be an example of the code that can be used by another to test and confirm the functionality of it, it is not necessarily a representation of the full code used on the prototype application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Testing and feedback. Testing of the prototype site will be limited to 25 users’ likely other university students; the test will confirm the site is function that they’re able to retrieve pricing listed on the site are accurate as-well as to provide feedback of what they think of the premise of B2B. The testing of the web scrapping code will be limited to being able to manually run the code and retrieve pricing data from a single source from at-least 2 products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database Design deliverables will be limited to the data dictionary, identify table, relationship diagram and a csv extract of product table
                    </li>

                <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

                <p>
                    Below is a list of tools and technologies we have used throughout the Bang 4 Buck Project. This is non exhaustive list. There are lots of others. This just highlights what we believe to be the most heavily used/important tools and technologies used throughout the project so far
                </p>

                <ul class="small-li">
                    <li>
                        MYSQL: Is a relational database management system. We required one to build our prototype database we selected MySQL because it is popular database management system, our team have had prior experience with it, it is open source, reliable, scalable, and fast. We used version X (MySQL, 2022)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        WebStorm by JetBrains: Was the primary text/code editor used throughout project for several members of the team for a multitude of tasks including coding the team website, the prototype website etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Visual studio code: A source code edited developed by Microsoft that can be used with a variety of programming languages such as Javascript, pyhton, C++, Rust. Visual studio code uses the same editor component seen within Azure Devops. We used version 1.70.2.  (Wikipedia, 2022). This was used to build the SQL scripts and test them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Front end development: we used HTML, CSS, for both the team and prototype website. (GeeksforGeeks, 2022) (Wikipedia, n.d.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python:  We used python to create the Web Scrapper that scrap product and pricing data fro various website such as Jw.com.au to populate into our prototype website. Python is a popular high-level general-purpose language used for a range of purposes such as web development, automation, and data analysis. We used version 3.8 of python  (Analytics Vidhya, 2017)(Coursera, 2022)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GitHub: We used GitHub heavily for both our team and prototype website. This was used as version control for our codes for both websites. We also used it to host both websites temporarily via github pages Github is primarily a version control hosting service using GIT which is a distribution version control. Primary used for software development version control. It is popular website, now owned by Microsoft. It has lot of features and functions including such as github page which allow you to effectively host your own website through them. (Wikipedia, 2022)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Microsoft Teams: We have used this heavily and is integral part of the project process, we’ve used it to communicate with team members, collaborate using a variety of it’s features and functions, such as screen sharing, working on documents simultaneously. We have used to track the progress of our tasks and project using the planner and sharepoint lists. Microsoft Team as seen above is a communication and collaboration tool made by Microsoft that has lot of features and functions and integration with other Microsoft application such as office suite, sharepoint etc.

                <p>
                    Below you’ll see two sections, a product roadmap with when we expect to complete all 5 stages of this project plan as-well as a timeframe tabling, how Team TBD have and will have spent the first 15 weeks of this project. The two use somewhat different date ranges we the reality is we do not have the resources to complete all stages of the project including all the planning required before beginning the project to be completed within 15 weeks highlighted in the timeframe. Both the timeframe and roadmap are based off the idea that each member will have approximately 10 hours a week to work on the Bang 4 buck project.
