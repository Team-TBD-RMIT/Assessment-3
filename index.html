        <h3 class="headingOne">Who are Team TBD?</h3>
        <p>Team TBD are a group of 5 Passionate RMIT University Students who have banded together to deliver an
            outstanding assessment 2 and 3 for Introduction to IT, working together on a project that if it was to
            go live we believe would have a positive impact on Australian Consumers. </p>
        <br>
        <!------------------------------------------------- -->
        <h3>What does TBD Stand for?</h3>
        <p>It stands for to be determined. </p>
        <br>
        <!------------------------------------------------- -->
        <h3>Why To be Determined?</h3>
        <p>
            Because like the future our potential is boundless, the possibilities endless and we do not want to be
            limited to a singular idea. TBD stand for much than just to be decided, it stands for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tenacity – We are a determined team who strive to be at the forefront of technology and how
                it can benefit humanity
            </li>
            <li>Belief – We are believers of a better world; a better society and we believe that is possible
                through the innovation of technology
            </li>
            <li>Discovery – We're discoverers of tomorrow's innovations today, through the exploration of
                technologies and the furthering of our studies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tomorrow’s discoveries are yet to happen. The future is TBD.</p>

            <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, I am of British descent, and my family came over to Australia when I was
                just 1 year old from New Zealand, being granted Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a Certificate
                IV in health care, studied nursing for 2 years and I now work at Factory Blinds making hollands.
                One odd hobby I have is learning about personality systems and the categorization of these traits.
                I have spent many hours learning the MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) personality inventory and
                then I learned about Jungian cognitive functions which in the context of MBTI are the extroverted
                or introverted versions of Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, and Intuitive. A few years ago, a YouTuber
                came out with an expanded system that came from the MBTI inventory called objective personality
                types, which contains 512 types that I have spent over a hundred hours learning. </p>

            <p>My name is Meg Maroni, and I am apart of Team TBD. I was born and have lived majority of my life in
                Albany, a stunning coastal city in Western Australia, which boast a wealth of hiking trails,
                wildlife, and bush tracks that I enjoy taking advantage of in my leisure time. Here, I also finished
                my K-12 education and received my TAFE (technical and further education) credentials, earning my
                highest certificate – a Cert IV in Information and Technology – in 2020.

                I am honoured to have been named the 2020 Vocational Student of the Year by the Apex Club of Albany,
                and one of the 2020 Southern Regional TAFE Students of the year throughout the 12 campuses in the
                Great Southern Region in appreciation of my academic achievements. My current position as a
                Technical Support Officer for two primary schools and one secondary school in my area has given me
                extensive experience in managing, maintaining, and fixing the physical technological infrastructure
                and networking of medium-sized organisations.

            <p>Born 1989 in Sydney, Australia. I was released onto this world alongside The Simpsons and the release
                of Gameboy in Japan and North America. I have lived predominately in the outer Western Suburbs of
                Sydney in a region called the Hawkesbury. I currently both work and study IT.
                Outside of work and study, I live a rather simple and peaceful life. My most notable interest, to me
                at least would be Sci-fi. I love all things Sci-Fi including games, movies, shows, etc. I think it
                may be fairer to say I love all things space-related in general. On clear nights I love looking up
                at the night sky and gazing across the stars imagining the possibilities, similarly to IT. What
                draws me to it is the vastness of space, the unknown, and the possibilities. I believe in a brighter
                future for humanity, and I believe to get to that brighter future, we need to look to technology,
                and we need to look to space.

            <br>
            <p>My name is Malachi Cleland, and I was born and raised in rural Australia where I still live today.
                I am looking toward moving to Melbourne in the near future, having lived there for almost two years
                in the past in which I almost completed an advanced diploma degree.
                Hobbies I love include writing and drawing. I haven't drawn in a while actually, but pencil is my
                medium of choice as I am a bit of an art snob/purist with an opinion using a tablet and stylist is
                a bit of an easy route to art. It’s something about seeing my imagination forged that really
                satisfies my desires. Most of the time I’m not interested in technologies or gaming consoles, I
                will be reading my heart out.

                I learned Indonesian in my high school years, many moons ago. Though it’s instilled a desire to
                learn plenty of languages since (German at the top of the list). On the list of jobs I would love
                to have is a translator, because bridging down language barriers to bringing people together is a
                beautiful thing, in my opinion. Plus, if you do what you love you never call it work, right?

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Group Processes</h3>
        <h4 class="headingTwo">How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h4>
        <p>
            Team TBD worked reasonably well in Assessment 2. We had satisfactory communication throughout with 2 weekly
            formal meetings held on Mondays and Thursdays to review progress and discuss any blockers. We had somewhat
            utilized Microsoft Planner within teams to track tasks. There was also light communication via Microsoft
            Team chat for A2 related topics as-well as other topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this what satisfactory throughout the most part we found towards the end that this level of
            communication failed to withstand the pressures of “crunch time”. In the final weeks when it came time to
            put all the pieces together the team initially struggled and suffered from a breakdown in communication.
            Some driving factors of that is we had not continued to utilize the tools we had implemented to track the
            assessments progress and individually assigned tasks. Another factor was lack of team mentality due level
            of communication we had initially utilized resulting in members feeling more like strangers than a team.
            However, we combated this adversity with diplomacy and communication as-well as agreeing on several methods
            to help address the issues team members felt they faced, allowed us to finally achieve that unity as a team,
            including overcoming the breakdown in communication, leading to a strong finish as a team in completing the
            A2 Assessment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <!------------------------------------------------- -->
        <h4 class="headingTwo">Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</h4>
        <p>
            We will be introducing several additions to our processes for A3 and A5 having learned from troubles in
            assignment 2. There include the following
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuation of hosting 2 formal team meetings on Mondays and Thursdays at 7pm, scheduled ahead so
                all formal meetings for Team TBD are mapped out in Calendar available to all members.
            </li>
            <li>Introduction of a weekly impromptu meeting via MS teams for general team catch up and informal
                discussion about project, including meeting’s involving individuals tasked with the same assessment
                components.
            </li>
            <li>Introduction of milestones and deadline meetings where milestone have been completed or deadlines
                have been approached that do not fall within the normal official meeting schedule. The team will conduct
                special meeting to review and discuss the milestone or deadline outcome.  This will be short informal
                meeting mainly to mark the occasion of having reached a certain stage of the project
            </li>
            <li>We have discussed and agreed that all work in progress/draft content for all members to be
                accessible to the rest of the team either via team GitHub repository or the teams document library
            </li>
            <li>Introducing a requirement which was agreed by all members to utilize the Team A3 Microsoft Planner
                Kanban Style board for all tasks related to A3 and A5. Including a review and training session. The
                board will be reviewed weekly and discussed by all members.
            </li>
            <li>As A3 requires much more coding done by multiple members of the team, we will be more heavily relying
                on GitHub Commits audit trail to help us track progress in conjunction with the Microsoft planner list.
            </li>
            <li>We will be introducing Project milestones managed by the Milestone Apps within Microsoft teams.
                This will be used to track milestones of the group. This will also form the basis of our product roadmap
                illustration that be used as an artefact. Some of the milestones will include, but not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Completion of Data Scraper
                    </li>
                    <li>Infrastructure Setup
                    </li>
                    <li>Team Website
                    </li>
                    <li>A3 Content Draft
                    </li>
                    <li>A3 Report
                    </li>
                    <li>A5 draft script and Storyboard
                    </li>
                    <li>A5 Presentation Completion
                    </li>
                    <li>Prototype website
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                We will be using checklists. Either using Microsoft Excel or 365 list in conjunction with our
                milestones and planner app to ensure completion of the required tasks for our milestones.
            </li>
            <li>
                We will be having a group issue list to manage any issues or concerns raised by the team in relation
                to tasks or milestones for the assessment.
