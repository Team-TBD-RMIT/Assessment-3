        <h3 class="headingOne">Who are Team TBD?</h3>
        <p>Team TBD are a group of 5 Passionate RMIT University Students who have banded together to deliver an
            outstanding assessment 2 and 3 for Introduction to IT, working together on a project that if it was to
            go live we believe would have a positive impact on Australian Consumers. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What does TBD Stand for?</h3>
        <p>It stands for to be determined. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why To be Determined?</h3>
        <p>
            Because like the future our potential is boundless, the possibilities endless and we do not want to be
            limited to a singular idea. TBD stand for much than just to be decided, it stands for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tenacity – We are a determined team who strive to be at the forefront of technology and how
                it can benefit humanity
            </li>
            <li>Belief – We are believers of a better world; a better society and we believe that is possible
                through the innovation of technology
            </li>
            <li>Discovery – We're discoverers of tomorrow's innovations today, through the exploration of
                technologies and the furthering of our studies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tomorrow’s discoveries are yet to happen. The future is TBD.</p>

            <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, I am of British descent, and my family came over to Australia when I was
                just 1 year old from New Zealand, being granted Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a Certificate
                IV in health care, studied nursing for 2 years and I now work at Factory Blinds making hollands.
                One odd hobby I have is learning about personality systems and the categorization of these traits.
                I have spent many hours learning the MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) personality inventory and
                then I learned about Jungian cognitive functions which in the context of MBTI are the extroverted
                or introverted versions of Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, and Intuitive. A few years ago, a YouTuber
                came out with an expanded system that came from the MBTI inventory called objective personality
                types, which contains 512 types that I have spent over a hundred hours learning. </p>

            <p>My name is Meg Maroni, and I am apart of Team TBD. I was born and have lived majority of my life in
                Albany, a stunning coastal city in Western Australia, which boast a wealth of hiking trails,
                wildlife, and bush tracks that I enjoy taking advantage of in my leisure time. Here, I also finished
                my K-12 education and received my TAFE (technical and further education) credentials, earning my
                highest certificate – a Cert IV in Information and Technology – in 2020.

                I am honoured to have been named the 2020 Vocational Student of the Year by the Apex Club of Albany,
                and one of the 2020 Southern Regional TAFE Students of the year throughout the 12 campuses in the
                Great Southern Region in appreciation of my academic achievements. My current position as a
                Technical Support Officer for two primary schools and one secondary school in my area has given me
                extensive experience in managing, maintaining, and fixing the physical technological infrastructure

            <p>Born 1989 in Sydney, Australia. I was released onto this world alongside The Simpsons and the release
                of Gameboy in Japan and North America. I have lived predominately in the outer Western Suburbs of
                Sydney in a region called the Hawkesbury. I currently both work and study IT.
                Outside of work and study, I live a rather simple and peaceful life. My most notable interest, to me
                at least would be Sci-fi. I love all things Sci-Fi including games, movies, shows, etc. I think it
                may be fairer to say I love all things space-related in general. On clear nights I love looking up
                at the night sky and gazing across the stars imagining the possibilities, similarly to IT. What
                draws me to it is the vastness of space, the unknown, and the possibilities. I believe in a brighter
                future for humanity, and I believe to get to that brighter future, we need to look to technology,
                and we need to look to space.

            <p>My name is Patrick, and I am an Australian-born Filipino raised in Sydney, NSW Australia.
                I have a Certificate III in Information Technology (Networking) which I obtained in 2007 and I am
                currently taking online courses at RMIT with the goal of completing the Bachelor of Information

                completing first year subjects.

                I enjoy riding motorbikes when it’s warm and snowboarding when it’s cold. Lately I’ve been exploring
                and learning how to build applications by implementing a range of open-source software. I have
                learned that there is a lot of moving parts and technologies involved when constructing an
                application so when the parts eventually start working together it is deeply satisfying.

            <br>
            <p>My name is Malachi Cleland, and I was born and raised in rural Australia where I still live today.
                I am looking toward moving to Melbourne in the near future, having lived there for almost two years
                in the past in which I almost completed an advanced diploma degree.
                Hobbies I love include writing and drawing. I haven't drawn in a while actually, but pencil is my
                medium of choice as I am a bit of an art snob/purist with an opinion using a tablet and stylist is
                a bit of an easy route to art. It’s something about seeing my imagination forged that really
                satisfies my desires. Most of the time I’m not interested in technologies or gaming consoles, I
                will be reading my heart out.

                I learned Indonesian in my high school years, many moons ago. Though it’s instilled a desire to
                learn plenty of languages since (German at the top of the list). On the list of jobs I would love
                to have is a translator, because bridging down language barriers to bringing people together is a
                beautiful thing, in my opinion. Plus, if you do what you love you never call it work, right?

        <img src="Images/profile/profilesCompiled.PNG" alt="profilesCompiled.png" class="profile-image">
        <h4 class="headingTwo">How is his information helpful</h4>
        <p>
            The results of the test were mildly helpful, the primary value was promoting self-reflection in the
            individual and how they perceived their own results. We do not believe these tests impacted the
            formation of the team nor were they a driving factor in the ongoing actions of the team. The result of
            the nature had minor impact on how roles and work were assigned to the team members. The team has
            discussed the results and again while somewhat insightful, the consensus appeared to be that these kinds
            of tests are limited and do not offer the depth of accuracy to truly analyse an individual and provide
            worthwhile insight into how they may or may not contribute to the team or what role they make undertake.
            Though in reviewing the personality tests we did note some similarities amongst ourselves that proved
            interesting if nothing else. The similarities included:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>All but one team member tested as a visual learner with everyone agreeing with their learning
                style results were represented accurately.
            </li>
            <li>All had introverted as a trait and all members agreed they were introverted to one degree or
                another. We feel this trait may be common in the industry across the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                We had 3 members who tested as an INFP (Mediators), and we pondered if this result may be common
                among those in the IT industry.
            </li>

        <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
        <img src="Images/profile/jobDataCompiled.PNG" alt="jobDataCompiled.png" class="profile-image">

        <h4>What common elements are there?</h4>
        <p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of common elements  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the roles or paths to the roles (bar one) require reasonable in-depth coding/developer and
                knowledge surrounding various programming languages, a common one being JAVA.</li>
            <li>All, bar one, require a relevant tertiary qualification such as a Bachelor of Information
                Technology to be eligible. </li>
            <li>3 Roles are remarkably similar, with two being near identical, being 2 Software Engineering
                roles and 1 Front End Developer.  </li>
            <li>All roles require strong analytical and/or problem-solving skill. </li>
            <li>All roles require the person to have strong teamwork and collaboration skills. </li>
            <li>Several of the roles require various leadership skills. </li>
            <li>Several of the roles require familiarities and skills associated with project management, either
                as part of the project or leading it. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What differentiates each position</h4>
        <p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the notable differences between the roles </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One role requires a Ph.D. before being eligible.</li>
            <li>Two of the roles could be considered quite late-stage and advanced positions in one career path,
                requiring 10+ years of education or work experience while the others are reasonably more on the
                side of intermediary roles to be considered.
            </li>
            <li>Only one role requires skill or experience with graphic application such as Illustrator.
            </li>
            <li>Only one role requires skills or knowledge specific to project methodologies PRINCE2, PMBOK, SCRUM,
                etc.
            </li>
            <li>Only one role requires experience in sensor fusion or expertise in usage of signal and imaging
                processing practices and techniques
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How similar or different are the career plans across the group</h4>
        <p>Our teams' career plans at the most basic level are somewhat similar. All involved completing a relevant
            bachelor’s degree in information technology, computer science, information systems, software
            engineering, or similar certification. Most involve pursuing further expertise and skills by completing
            MOOC courses or similar such as Scriba or industrial-specific courses such as PRINCE2/PMBOK
            methodologies. Several involve working in similar roles to that of the group to build further work
            experience for eligibility for their desired roles.
        </p>
        <p>Where they differ, at least in two of the cases, is the timeline to reach a stage where the person would
            be considered skilled and experienced enough to fill such a position. Both Senior Project management
            and Machine Learning Researcher positions will require 10+ years of additional education and/or relevant
            work experience. Machine learning Researcher, in particular, by far has the greatest academic
            requirements requiring a Ph.D. on top of establishing a career in similar roles prior to being
            eligible.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Team TBD's ideal jobs are both diverse yet similar; we have two software engineers and a Front-End
            Developer, yet we also have Machine Learning Researcher and a Senior Project manager.  While the nature
            and requirements of the jobs are different in each case even among the software engineering roles there
            are some core similarities amongst almost all the roles along with some unique differences between them.
            What is interesting to see is some of these roles are obtainable relatively soon, if they stick to their
            career plan. While the other two are quite senior roles and will require many years of further education
            and experience before the team members would be realistically eligible to obtain their ideal jobs. See
            below for more information.
