            <h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What does it do?</h4>
            <p>At its core blockchain is a distributed, immutable, and decentralized way to store and manage data  (Rosencrance, 2021). Blockchain refers to a collection of data stored in a peer-to-peer network as a list, with each collection of data (or a block) linked together so that the list can only be added and previous blocks on the chain cannot be altered. Blockchain does not refer to single entity or one mega chain but only the technology or system used to create lists of collection of data (Hayes, 2022). Blockchain can be thought of as a public ledger where users who hold blocks can buy, sell, or simply show the information stored in the block by adding to the ledger (IBM, 2022) (Likens, 2017).</p>
            <p>Keeping an accurate record of the Blockchain is achieved in two ways, firstly when a new block is added to the chain it holds a number generated based on the previous block (3Blue1Brown, 2022). If a user did try and edit a block the number generated on the next block will no longer be valid, to successfully fool the system, the user would need enough computing power to regenerate a new number and edit every single block in the chain following the block edited. This system comes from cryptography and is called SHA256 which is a hash function where if one part is edited the number associated with the block changes completed (Scott, 2013), SHA256 refers to 256 bytes of data. The hash function also increases the amount of work need to produce a block.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now let’s say this user did edit every following block how a user would tell that this is the falsified ledger or any blockchains with any conflicting record. Blockchains use a system called proof of work (PoW) where the accurate or correct blockchain is the one that is longest or the one with the most work is the accurate blockchain. This is where the use of a hash function is important, because the hash functions requires a computer simple guess the combination of SHA256 need to satisfy the has function it greatly increases the amount of computer power need to falsify the blockchain (3Blue1Brown, 2022). This method works because the combined computing power of the users updating the blockchain is far more than anyone person or group could feasibly maintain for long enough for it to actually fool anyone (Frankenfield, 2022) (3Blue1Brown, 2022). Though if you had a blockchain with only a few users the cost of falsifying the blockchain is much less (Frankenfield, 2022).</p>
            <p>Users are verified using a system of private and public keys (3Blue1Brown, 2017) (CONSENSYS, 2022), user who created the digital identity knows the private key while the public key, which is linked to the private key, is used to sign when the user adds to the blockchain. This signature depends on both the message and the private key which produces a different signature every time. The public key is only used to verify that the private key associated with the public key produced the signature (CONSENSYS, 2022). A hash function is used to combine the message and the private key to produce a random combination of 256 bytes of data (1’s and 0’s) this is called SHA256. Therefore, if a part of the signature or message is edited the SHA256 would be a completed different combination of 256 bytes requiring the computer to simply run through every possible combination of 256 bytes until they reach the number which satisfies the hash function (3Blue1Brown, 2017) (Scott, 2013). </p>
            <p>What blockchain does is provide a decentralized system to track and transfer information.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>Blockchain has a broad range of applications and has the potential to impact a large range of industries. One area we have already see blockchain make an impact is cryptocurrency, blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the blocks are able to be leveraged as currency and adding to the chain is used to transfer the currency between people. This application allows people to trade currency without the involvement of governments or banks. Meaning people using cryptocurrencies can avoid tariffs, bans or regulations imposed by government or banks. Because of this cryptocurrency lend themselves to use by anyone hoping to avoid their governments attention or who think a bank may freeze their assets, think of activist groups, protesters, rebels, dissidents, far-right extremist, and criminals (Nelson, 2022). Governments will of course be looking for ways to track and analysis cryptocurrencies.) (IBM, 2022)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Blockchain has the potential to securely store medical records. With the increasing digitalization of medical records, the health-care industry is facing a great challenge trying to store medical records securely while still having access to it. At times doctors need immediate access to medical records especially in case of life-threatening emergencies (Neimerg, 2021). Because blockchain is fundamentally a giant ledger, when adding a block these blocks could easily be used to hold medical information. The same technology used to ensure the security of blockchain would ensure the security of the medical records, meaning immutable (which medical records need to be) and doctors would all be able to see the same information once they have access. (Likens, 2017) (Neimerg, 2021)</p>
            <p>Briefly let’s discuss the use of blockchain to provide proof to consumers that their food is being safely handled and transported. By tracking the produce through its journey from farm to customer publicly companies can provide real evidence to back up their claims (IBM , 2022).</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>Firstly, Secure medical records are one of the applications of blockchain that most interests me and I know would have great impact on my friends and family that work in healthcare and me as a patient. If patients trusted that their health information was kept secure and couldn’t be hacked (Jercich, 2021) or accessed by an unauthorized person patients could confidently share sensitive information with their healthcare providers. Healthcare workers wouldn’t have access limited by medical records not being transferred between doctor’s surgeries (it can cost a $100 per person to transfer records between surgeries), files lost between hospitals, losing data to buggy or outdate electronic health records (Neimerg, 2021).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Secondly, I think that blockchain if applied to managing the massive amount of data and large networks used for the internet of things (IoT) (Rosencrance, 2021) would help me and other users feel more secure in using home devices that are connected to the IoT because the data would be stored securely and is harder to hack (Rosencrance, 2021). One of the reason I attempt to avoid IoT devices is because I don’t know where or how the data collected is being used, blockchain could provide the solution as potential the owner of the device could access the data their own device produces and have control over who access it or even just that the company that builds the devices is more likely to be able to keep the data secure  (Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner, 2022).</p>
            <p>If this technology became widely used it would impact my daily life. The ability to identify how and where food is produced and to know that the information you are seeing is actual accurate is something I would use when choosing which foods to purchase particularly things like meat and seafood where unsafe handling means a higher risk of illness.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What does it do?</h4>
            <p>Machine learning is a rapidly developing technological field that builds its structure on human deduction skills to produce a branch of artificial intelligence capable of making predictions with the highest degree of accuracy, using patterns and historical data provided to it. This technology has been developed and used in a variety of fields, including manufacturing, natural language processing, medical science, graphing and timelines, games, social media, and more. Google, one of the top manufacturers of cutting-edge technologies, has recently introduced a few tools for public testing this year that implement the newest of machine learning algorithms, including the LaMDA 2 and The AI Test Kitchen.</p>
            <p>In order to give the Google Assistant more natural conversation techniques using generative language models, Google release its Language Model for Dialog Applications (LaMDA) in 2021&nbsp;(Collins &amp; Ghahramani, 2021). This algorithm has since been enhanced with the release of LaMDA 2 at the 2022 Google I/O conference&nbsp;(Cnet Highlights, 2022). Before the technology is ready for the Google Assistant as envisioned, they have developed the AI Test Kitchen, an application that will introduce the new functionalities of LaMDA 2 and will collect user feedback about their experiences to debug and finalize the model. It is divided into three demos:</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li><strong>Image It</strong>: a model that asks users to input an idea as a conversation topic and the model will respond with &ldquo;imaginative and relevant descriptions&rdquo;,</li>
                <li><strong>List It:</strong> a model which allows users to input a topic and the model will break this down into related subtasks to make multitasking easier and prompt the user with subtopics they may not have thought of.</li>
                <li><strong>Think About It:</strong> an open-ended chat the user can interact with to test if the model will stay on-topic (the topic is currently dogs).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Google announced in the conference it is also releasing multiple other developments in machine learning to enhance its user&rsquo;s experience in other applications. Included in this is:</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li><strong>the Pathways Language Model (PaLM):</strong> Googles most recent model for processing language, which was trained using 540 billion parameters. It was created to develop an artificial intelligence system that could manage millions of different activities in addition to difficult learning and reasoning tasks, and it is seen as a peak in the future of all language models.</li>
                <li><strong>Multisearch on Lens:</strong> The ability to search with images and text at the same time, for better refining and customization to tailor to a user&rsquo;s online shopping experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Immersive view in Maps:</strong> A computer generated system of images combining satellite street view images to create an in-person experience of destinations with depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Shot Machine Translation: </strong>Introduced support for 24 new languages in Google Translate using their &lsquo;Zero-Shot Machine Translation&rsquo; model which is a combination of NPL and ML to have the capabilities to translate text into another language without ever seeing an example, although it is still under improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The future endeavours of machine learning are vast, but a few developments seem feasible within the next few years including a surge in Quantum Computing and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Integrating Machine Learning into Quantum computing offers huge advancements to the analysis of data with a theoretical increase in data processing capabilities utilizing its quibits and superior processing power. This technology does already exist but there is no commercially available model and much of it is still all theoretical, requiring further funding and development. Automated Machine Learning is the other future development that looks promising which involves creating automated systems for time-consuming, repetitive tasks within machine learning model development. This means that former tasks that initially required human maintenance and knowledge of machine learning can be fully automated to allow non-experts to utilize machine learning models and technologies within their businesses and produce faster solutions. (Google, n.d.)&nbsp;(Barik, 2022)<br />&nbsp;</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>The idea that any modern organisation would benefit from the usage of machine learning is simply prompted by the fact that it can work around-the-clock, quickly summarise vast volumes of data, improves over time as it continues to work, and is incredibly versatile within any industry. The current benefits and machine learning adoption within businesses is already being analysed across Australia including The DiUS National Pulse Report of 2021&nbsp;(Dius, 2021), which outlines key trends of machine learning clearly increasing in appeal among businesses, with 21% at the time using ML already in production processes and 82% of organizations interested in its usage within their business, combined with 86% of the data sample seeing ML as a key technology for the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This capability is daunting for some as it can seamlessly replace human-orientated tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, dangerous, or prone to human error. A specific study&nbsp;(Farrel &amp; Giannoutsos, 2022) that examined the benefit of using machine learning technologies over human labour was that by Christopher-John L. Farrell and John Gianoutsos which explored machine learning models that identified wrong blood in tube (WBIT) errors that affected a laboratories complete blood count (CBC) results and found that the machine learning models exceeded the accuracy of manual review identification. Now, this is an extremely specific case applied to a small field, but it demonstrates how Machine learning can be applied to remove the human element for a more proficient performance to benefit humankind, thus provoking the thought will this also eventually remove humans from the work processes altogether or just workforce positions dangerous or boring for humans? Another concern with ML is how it may eventually make a decision that may impact the public when it will be used for more prominent technologies or global studies such as how to combat global warming or a pandemic. (NASDAQ, 2022)</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>Machine Learning is already integrated into most elements involved in my everyday life, including in my smart home (IoT), digital media and streaming services, banking, health care, transportation, and more. As backend machine learning modules use my cache history across platforms to personally tailor my experience, I constantly notice that the topics in my social media feeds are becoming increasingly specific about things I am interested in or may have searched recently, and this has been of benefit to me by sometimes offering suggestions or observations that help me to enjoy the experience more or find the things I want. I anticipate that the tools I use will continue to capture my personal preferences to the point where any online activity I engage in will be observed and used as input for an algorithm. It&rsquo;s always featured in Sci-Fi movies that robots will know everything we do and plot to terminate the human race, but we have already arrived at this stage of &lsquo;privacy invasion&rsquo; using ML and I feel as a society eventually we will adapt to function similar to open source with all our data open to anyone to view.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning in health care is another critically important addition to help myself, friends and family, and society through the struggles of serious disease detection and early diagnosis with efficiency and precision. My sister recently went through a series of tests and surgeries following an early diagnosis of stage 3 cervical cancer. Without the technologies implemented to help detect the tumours she had; we would be looking at the prospect of a terminal condition. Machine learning is advancing the detection of such tumours using combined methods of image processing and abnormality detection. A recent report about predictions of cervical cancer identification by photonic method combined with machine learning is just one such example to further advance our diagnostic detection methods using ML to save human life. (Kruczkowski, et al., 2022)</p>

            <h2>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What does it do?</h4>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NPL) and Chatterbots are a blend of machine learning, deep learning and computational linguistics models that focus primarily on simulating and comprehending human written and spoken words, with the goal of humans being able to interact with computers such as they would with each other. Examples of this that exist in current processes today include applications that translate text between languages, devices that can respond to spoken commands (Amazon Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant), and those that can quickly summarise large quantities of text input such as online paraphrasing tools (Quillbot, Grammarly). The use of NPL varies among its user base as the general public are more used to voice-activated convenience devices like GPS or home assistants, but in business and enterprise operations NPL technologies are implemented to make processes operate smoother, boost productivity among the workforce, and provide a seamless procession of high priority business procedures. (IBM, 2022)</p>
            <p>In many modern everyday applications and devices, machine intelligence is the main powerhouse behind these devices that makes them so attractive and convenient, which is ultimately powered by natural language processing and chatterbots. A few examples are as follows (IBM, 2022):</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li><strong>Email Phishing Detection:</strong> Current email spam detection tools analyse the written text with NPL to detect trends that frequently occur in spam or phishing. This can include identifying significant poor grammar or spelling, intimidating or threatening language, or the overuse of financial vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Text summarization tools:</strong> This application breaks down long and lengthy amounts of text into smaller relevant conclusions and summaries which simplifies the process to read and comprehend large documentations such as research articles or reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Multilingual neural machine translation services:</strong> Google Translate the predominant service implemented for decreasing the language barrier between individuals across the globe. What makes it so effective is that more than just swapping out words from one language to another, it has evolved to capture the context of the source language, so translations come across accurately in both tone and meaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media analysis:</strong> A critical tool in use with NPL technologies and businesses is the ability to analyse language within reviews, comments, postings on social media and extracts the emotion and attitude of customers towards their products, promotions, and upcoming events. </li>
                <li><strong>Virtual agents/assistants:</strong> Virtual assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa identify patterns in voice commands using speech recognition, and then answer with the necessary action or helpful comments. This applies to chatbots as well, but with text-based input instead of voice. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>IBM is one of the leading pioneers in NPL technologies, providing many tools focused towards businesses with the goal of streamlining the automation process of complex procedures, while also acquiring critical observations of business operations. These include (IBM, 2022):</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li><strong>IBM Watson Discovery: </strong>An intelligent (AI-powered) search tool that utilizes text analysis to find business knowledge buried within vast amounts of enterprise data and dismantles information silo’s as they cause more harm than good within an organization.</li>
                <li><strong>IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU): </strong>The module is used to glean meaning and metadata from unstructured text input by utilizing text analytics to uncover the underlying information within a business’s data, including categories, classification, entities, keywords, sentiment, emotion, relations, and syntax.</li>
                <li><strong>IBM Watson Assistant: </strong>Enterprise-level software developers can integrate an artificial intelligence (AI) virtual assistant (VA) into the programme they are creating and brand the assistant as their own using IBM Watson Assistant, a white label cloud service.</li>
                <li><strong>IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data:</strong> This tool extracts key clinical concepts, such as conditions, medications, allergies, and procedures, from important clinical notes taken including discharge summaries, literature, clinical trial protocols and more to provide more meaningful data relevant for further insights into patients and the clinical business.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>Most areas mentioned above are going to improve as the technology advances over time including improved speech interpretation leading to more accurate responses , ‘smart’ devices will be able to execute their tasks to a higher degree, more conversational and understanding chatterbots will be able to handle 24/7 customer service and support with better suggestions and mostly handing customer requests on their own.  </p>
            <p>As the Coronavirus pandemic highlighted a critical need for social interaction for health and wellbeing, there was a boom in the chatterbot industry with many sectors taking advantage of the need for social stimulation such as simulated customer support (Badiyani, 2021), including prominent organisations such as the World Health Organisation deploying a Covid information chatbot (WHO, 2020)  and the development of a niche market of companionship applications such as Replika (Replika, 2022)  that targeted this need for substitution of human interaction for artificial interaction, with the creation of idealised personalities in companion apps and devices. Chatterbots can also make inroads into the mental health community, acting as emotional support devices. Medical professionals can make more accurate diagnoses or substitute diagnoses in lieu of a face-to-face appointment (Wolters Kluwer, 2020), as well as having programs that act as healthcare assistants that acquire information and prioritise illnesses (Poh, 2020).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Within businesses NPL also offers the prospect to help professionals make better informed judgments when making client effecting decisions based upon social media analysis tools when implementing new products or procedures or using text summarization tools to accurately analyse a patient’s data from doctor reports and test results within a quicker period of time. The myth that this technology will evolve to replace humans is untrue, but NPL technologies will definitely compel businesses to alter the way they conduct themselves to reach a more productive and greater quality environment.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>On a personal level I will remain unaffected by these changes as I do not actively use smart devices or technologies that take advantage of Natural Language Processing. I may gain some utility out of 24-hour customer support in my future prospects as I am inevitably a consumer at the whim of cooperation products and processes within the modern world, such as navigating difficult to understand instructions from purchased products or software from companies after typical office hours. The advancements in smart devices may well be the jump-off point for some of my friends into buying smart home devices as the ease of access and accessibility aspects they offer to daily tasks at the mere asking of a question could definitely improve the average humans daily experience and overall happiness. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Furthermore I definitely see a benefit to these technologies benefitting the elderly and disabilities communities as a personal assistant could regularly remind elderly citizens of tasks and appointments they must attend, plus potentially adding in a companion into their lives where it may be difficult to seek out physically. For the disability community I am aware it is benefitting many people with technologies such as TalkItt, as application that can speak for users with speech impairments by speaking sentences for the user based upon their vocal cues that they train the model to recognise. This is just one of many AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) applications powered by NPL that’s advancing ease of access and communication for those with disabilities to be able to talk and communicate with others, boosting their independence and happiness. NPL will integrate more with my life as I navigate into the future, and I am excited to see it's potential to help myself and those around me.</p>

        <div class="container-card">
            <h2>Cloud, Services, Servers</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What does it do?</h4>
            <p>What are cloud services &amp; servers? Cloud services is a broad term that refers to a wide range of services available on demand to companies and customers over the internet. &nbsp;The services can provide access to computing, storage, and other applications and resources without the need for on-premises infrastructure or hardware&nbsp;(uniserveit, 2021). They&rsquo;re designed to provide easy access and potentially cost-effective alternatives to physical servers.</p>
            <p>Cloud services are usually offered and sometimes managed by cloud computing vendors and service providers. They&rsquo;re made available to customers from a pool of cloud servers available (virtual servers) from the provider&rsquo;s datacenters so there's no need for a company to host applications on its own on-premises servers&nbsp;(Google Cloud, 2022). What is a cloud server? A&nbsp;cloud server&nbsp;is a virtual server (rather than a physical server) usually hosted in a datacenter by a cloud provided and delivered over a network (typically the internet) and can be accessed on demand by multiple users.&nbsp; Cloud servers have all the same capabilities as a physical server delivering processing, storage, and application solutions.</p>
            <p>There are 3 core types of cloud services</p>
            <br>
            <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides customers with virtualized resources of servers, operating systems, storage capacity and networking resources&nbsp;<span>(Perry, 2020)</span>. Such providers include Cherry servers which focus on server infrastructure, Microsoft Azure which focus on providing business with IT solutions, and google cloud infrastructure which prioritise speed and security many others in the market. IaaS only provides the hardware, network, servers, and a virtual machine for the customer to run&nbsp;<span>(Bernazzani, 2022)</span>. Customer is still responsible for what operating system they want to use, the middleware, how they manage runtime, managing data, and building the application. While this means more work for the company or customer it allows for much greater control&nbsp;<span>(IBM Cloud Education, 2021)</span>.</p>
            <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides customers with everything that IaaS offers in addition to managing the operating system, middleware, and runtime. Leaving the customer free to focus on managing the data and applications&nbsp;<span>(IBM Technology, 2019)</span>. PaaS is usually used by a developer looking to quickly build an application or website without needing to work the infrastructure, operating system, middleware, and runtime. It allows developers to quickly create and delete applications, and scale based on demand&nbsp;<span>(Bernazzani, 2022)</span>. Generally, when using PaaS it&rsquo;s hard to migrate an application to a different vendor so once an application is built on PaaS it is hard to move it off the cloud or to a new vendor&nbsp;<span>(IBM Technology, 2019)</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>SaaS the third-party company now is responsibility for everything; with customer simply making an account and using their product&nbsp;<span>(IBM Cloud Education, 2021)</span>. SaaS means the infrastructure, platform, and software are all provide to the customer by the company&nbsp;<span>(Bernazzani, 2022)</span>. This is the most known and used type of cloud service. It is a broad grouping that encompasses a variety of services such as productivity suite (Office 365), file storage and backup (One drive), web emails (Gmail), CRM(Salesforces), and project management tools (Trello). When using this type of cloud service it means that the company is responsible for all parts of storing the data, they are in control of data security and how the data is managed&nbsp;<span>(Raza, 2019)</span>.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>Cloud Technology greatly impacts Australian businesses in today Modern always on the move interconnected world; Cloud services are utilized from Sole trader to the largest of corporation across all industries. It was estimated that 42% of businesses are paying for cloud services contrast to just 31% in 2015-16. In the 5 years leading up to 2019 it estimated that Australian businesses have spent $9.4 Billion. (Deloitte, 2019). What are driving Australian businesses to move their systems and services to the cloud? Deloitte conducted research and found the following</p>
            <ul class="small-li">
                <li>34% of business listed improving customer service as a driver</li>
                <li>38% of Australian business adopted cloud services to try to keep up with their competition</li>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>Cloud technologies affect me both professionally and personally. I utilize cloud technologies every day of my life already and my reliance on them will only increase. I am utilizing it right now to write this essay, using Spotify to stream music to my computer as I write to help me focus, to utilizing Word which is automatically saving my document as I type this, keeping it save.</p>
            <p>Professionally, the company I work for in the past few has gone through a digital technology transformation and continues to do so. I played an integral part in rolling out 365 across the entire business in 2020. We migrated our mail server to it (exchange online), Our file servers (sharepoint/one drive) and even our management of authenticating users and managing devices (Azure Active directory and Intune). Since the adoption of Microsoft 365 alone, Cloud technologies have become the lifeblood of the company as our company relies heavily on our email system.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The emergence and adoption of cloud technologies in today&rsquo;s world just isn&rsquo;t affecting me, it is affecting those in my life who are far from tech savvy, and one might even say technophobes. In the past few years, I&rsquo;ve painstakingly introduced my mother, her husband and even my grandfather to adopting cloud technology. I&rsquo;ve got all my family using services like Netflix and Amazon over bloated, costly inefficient traditional paid TV like Foxtel. I haven&rsquo;t just helped them personally but their business as-well. I help them implement QuickBooks a cloud accounting software and Microsoft 365 through using exchange online for emails, office 365 for their productivity, they now also use the cloud every single day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In summary cloud technology affects every facet of the lives of those around me, from the way we do groceries, to the way we interact with our friends &amp; family, to how we produce work or collaborate with co-workers, to how our businesses interact with one and other and operate their day-to-day operations. This is only going to continue to change further as cloud technology evolves.&nbsp;</p>
