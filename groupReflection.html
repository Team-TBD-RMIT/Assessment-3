        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <h2 class="subTitle">What went well</h2>
        <p>Several of us had done and our individual reflection prior to our group reflection discussion. It was rewarding to see that everyone commented on the improved and more dedicated use of the planner and how was effective it was in managing the tracking task progression.  After our discussion we all agreed communication was over-all stronger, team found it was easier to ask for help or get feedback. That the roles and responsibilities throughout this assignment were more clearly defined than last assignment and that all our group processes including our meets improved our experience of this assignment. We all agree the assignment was managed by all individuals over-all. </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What could be improved</h2>
        <p>Again, even prior group reflection discussion it seems our members were in sync with one and other regarding the area we could have improved upon. We all felt agree the area of improvement for this assignment was centred around our initial deliverables/Milestones of the project. We were ultimately too ambitious with the amount of work we had set out for ourselves. Upon discussion we believe there was several reasons to our fail to deliver on our ambitious outcomes such as lacking more concise timeline/dates for our milestones, we found ourselves being reactive instead of proactive. If we had mapped a timeframe/timeline before instead of during this could have helped. We also could have been clearer in defining those deliverables and milestones with each member to make sure everyone fully understood what was involved in those deliverables and milestones.  We chalked it up to inexperience in both managing and working in a project of this scale and type.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What was surprising</h2>
        <p>The team found it surprising how little project/team related issues we had and how we still managed to complete most of our deliverables despite being overly ambitious in our initial scope and underestimating just how much time we’d require to complete some deliverables or  how much time we’d have in general as we ended up with less time to work on our project then we had initial given ourselves due to us requiring balancing work, study, life relationships and obligations. Everyone worked hard, everyone supported each other and helped with each other roles. </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What we have learned about groups</h2>
        <p>Even When the communication is good things can always be improved with better communication. . We learnt that the benefits of working in a group outweigh the negative when in a good team that communicates. We all enjoyed working with each other and hope to continue our relationships and get the opportunity to together in the future again.</p>

            <h2>Bronagh Falloon</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>Team communication had improved, and it was easy ask for help or get feedback on part of the assignment. Team meeting helped clarify any issues and make plans to complete the work. Roles were clearly defined and helped us to work effectively as team.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>Concrete plans to reach each milestone we set for ourselves. We did not reach all the goals we had initially set for ourselves partly due to failing to have set dates for each milestone.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>It surprised me well our team continued to work together and fill in gaps as needed based on what needed to get done and if anyone got overwhelmed. I thought after working together for longer issues may have come up that were not obvious earlier.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>I think I continued to learn the same lesson I learned during the last assignment. To communicate with my team and build trust with each other so that we can work together effectively.</p>

            <h2>Meg Maroni</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>With the group utilizing the team task planner agenda more, it felt like tasks progression and understanding each members roles was a much more streamlined experience compared to that of A2. It did require a bit more effort and attention to be paid towards the Teams page to ensure the tasks are getting ticked off and assigned within an appropriate timeframe as they are completed or appear, but it was still a beneficial effort necessary for our success.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>I feel as a team we were slightly too ambitious with the deliverables with this project, and I interpret that as us being inexperienced in creating a project like this before, as all team members have the capable skills to pull this project together and really get a functioning web application together but just lack of available time, balancing work-study-life relationships. </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>Even though we over-extended our scope, we managed to complete most of the deliverables with everyone’s hard work and dedication.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>That even when I feel like I am failing the group by being behind on deliverable due dates, they have been incredibly supportive and assist with tasks when overburdened by external factors. I have been incredibly fortunate to work with this group of amazing individuals and hope to keep my friendships and work opportunities with them as my studies continue.</p>

            <h2>Scott Percival</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>I believe this time around our communication was stronger. We better utilized the outlined group processes more which included better utilizing the planner in and out of the meeting process to track tasks. We utilized checklist to review over-all progress towards ensure deliverables were completed. Over-all I think this assignment was better managed by all members than the previous.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>We could have improved by better outlining and understanding the scope of our deliverables for the project at the start. We underestimated how long some components would take to get on top of.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>Time is always an issue no matter how well you plan. We had initially planned to get further in the project with the time we had than we did. Sometimes things happen and with experience, we better learn how to not just plan for them but work through them.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>The duality of it. Some days I would have preferred to just have to deal with individual assignments, other days I was glad to be working on something as a group. It can be frustrating at times but ultimately rewarding. I could not have achieved the quality of work that I believe I contributed without the support of the group. I have enjoyed working with this team and hope I get the chance to do so again in the future.</p>

            <h2>Malachi Cleland</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>In spite of the occasional communication failure, I thought it was pretty good being able to quickly and easily call a meeting that we all - or those invited - found suitable, be it for an informal chat or an ad hoc meeting.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>Daily updates. Both for myself personally and in future to incorporate into group teachings, the benefit of daily updates to see how everyone is going, even if it is just to say ‘I haven’t done anything’ - no matter how hard it may be - to give all other teams members an accurate portrait of where a person is at.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>Not getting my work done. Once the initial terror resides I’ve no issues with group work and have participated in group projects for years, however this is my third online group assignment and it was distinctly uncomfortable to be a ‘weak link’. It’s one thing to let yourself down, but something else entirely letting other people down.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>The importance of communication, in particular the effectiveness of instant communication. Having been through similar circumstances before I was unperturbed to respond via text while others used video and audio. However, once I attained the ability to communicate with parity I experienced a new level of engagement with the team.</p>
