        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <h2 class="subTitle">What went well</h2>
        <p>We were all on the same page about what went well. Despite a breakdown of communication effectiveness during the middle. We all felt communication throughout the project was good, especially towards the end as we adapted our strategies to address the issues.  We believe we also created a positive environment for the group to be able to be themselves. Finally, we felt there was clear overview of who needed to complete what. </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What could be improved</h2>
        <p>We were in sync with one and other regarding the areas we believed could be improved. Such as implementing a solution of ensuring that any content being worked by an individual so that it available to the group allowing all see the progress, to gain perspective of their own progress in contract and more easily assist others who may need help and  to allow for continuation of work in-case unknown variables prevented the original contributor to continue that task. Despite agreeing we had good communication we feel even more communication going forward could such as daily informal check-in to see how the team is feeling as-well as seeing how they’re coming along with work, if there are any blockers or concerns etc would help.  We also felt we could have benefits from a better way to track and organize task progress and roles. </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What was surprising</h2>
        <p>What we all found surprising was the Team feeling we had towards the end. At the start we were strangers, we all had our concerns about working with strangers and at the beginning it felt that way. It made it hard to communicate effectively and lead to a breakdown of communication external issues came along. Everyone during this assessment had a significant issue outside of Uni to deal with. However, though determination we worked through it and adapted. Bringing us all much closer.  </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subTitle">What we have learned about groups</h2>
        <p>The importance of not just communication but regular communication is critical to effectively working as a team and fostering a team vibe. Even something as simple as a daily “Hey, how you are going” really helped everyone feel in the loop and part of the process. We also learned how important it is to be adaptable to ever evolving situations. Often there are life events that not necessarily affect you by someone else in the team which ultimately impacts everyone. Despite whatever is going on, work must continue so being ready to change priorities on task or change roles within the team is important. Finally, we learned difference between people and how they function can be difficult to navigate at first but as a team you learn to turn those differences into strengths. </p>

            <h2>Bronagh Falloon</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>I think the group communicated effectively because we had regular meetings and used them to update each other on our progress on the assignment, if we need help, and when we were going to work on the assignment. At the beginning we clearly assigned roles and tasks, which allowed us to work effectively as a team and prevent tasks from being forgotten. Because of regularly updates on our progress and schedules we were able to help each other when needed.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>At one time I worked on the same part of the assignment as Scott, so we had doubled up the work. In this case it wasn’t a problem because I had needed to rewrite what I had done so Scott’s work was helpful.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>It surprised my how motivating it was to work in group, general I get all my work done at the last minute but knowing that other people were relying on me helped to get my work done in a timely fashion.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>I learned that in groups you need to communicate what your working and how much you have done so that other members can appropriately plan their work load and help out when needed.</p>

            <h2>Meg Maroni</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>The group had excellent communication and idea-sharing skills, and it offered a friendly environment where any member could voice their worries and request support. This, in my opinion, was due to the team members' wide range of backgrounds, skills, ages, and experiences, which contributed to the team's good atmosphere.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>It would be beneficial to communicate current capability and completed components more accurately. At first, everyone was content with their parts and what was expected of them, but as communications broke down or were fabricated, the group ended up in a deficit because the task that the group was led to believe was in stages of completion, in reality was not even begun or left to the unknown and cased quite an amount of unjust stress on the rest of the team.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>That it took some time before it felt like a "group" until it was truly needed, and that I felt the few individuals that blossomed together during a period of stress will work wonderfully in the future.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>Because every team member has different circumstances that could affect their performance at any time, it is vitally necessary to be ready for anything. It is crucial to be adaptable and able to provide assistance and support in those circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Scott Percival</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>Team member who contributed had excellent and open communication. We struggled at the start but found our stride towards the end with completing tasks and communicating progress.  </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>Increased communication that we found towards the end could have greatly improved the start. As-well as more heavily relying on and utilizing the Kanban style planner we had initially setup or a similar method for improving how our tasks, goals and deadlines are revised and communicated. </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>My fellow group member great ideas and delivery of excellent content. There always doubt in a new group. I also found surprising how far constant informal communication even with something as a “hey, how are thing goings” can go in helping a group be more effective. </p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>Not everyone is as organized or as self-driven as others. Other may struggle with accountability. Some require more direction than others. Everyone experiences procrastination from time to time as-well.   It’s the nature of group work and explain why project managers are so fundamentally required role in a project.  Despite any difference in attitude, persona or capabilities in a group, a group still need to be function and be effective.  I am learning have visual, concise tasks, goals and deadline that regularly revised and communicated helps. </p>

            <h2>Malachi Cleland</h2>
            <h4 class="headingTwo">What went well </h4>
            <p>In spite of the occasional communication failure, I thought it was pretty good being able to quickly and easily call a meeting that we all - or those invited - found suitable, be it for an informal chat or an ad hoc meeting.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">What could be improved</h4>
            <p>Daily updates. Both for myself personally and in future to incorporate into group teachings, the benefit of daily updates to see how everyone is going, even if it is just to say ‘I haven’t done anything’ - no matter how hard it may be - to give all other teams members an accurate portrait of where a person is at.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
            <p>Not getting my work done. Once the initial terror resides I’ve no issues with group work and have participated in group projects for years, however this is my third online group assignment and it was distinctly uncomfortable to be a ‘weak link’. It’s one thing to let yourself down, but something else entirely letting other people down.</p>

            <h4 class="headingTwo">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
            <p>The importance of communication, in particular the effectiveness of instant communication. Having been through similar circumstances before I was unperturbed to respond via text while others used video and audio. However, once I attained the ability to communicate with parity I experienced a new level of engagement with the team.</p>
